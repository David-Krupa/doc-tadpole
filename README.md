# tadpole -- BrainGu Knowledge Capture 

## Problem Statement 

*  Knowledge capture and documentation create resilience and flexibility within an organization. All capture/curation activities reduce the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor). 

*  Creation of a team-specific process documentation roadmap increases the likelihood of team participation, both as teachers and learners. 

*  BrainGu is without any kind of institutional knowledge capture program, and exists wholly within the tribal knowledge space, which works for a very small organization, but does not scale. 

*  BrainGu requires a system of knowledge capture and transfer that honors both team expertise, and the dynamic nature of information in DevSecOps at this time. 

## Deliverables 

Preliminary and basic-level knowledge capture can be found [here](https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/wiki/Welcome-to-the-Tadpole-Wiki). 

 * Tactics, techniques, procedures germane to work methods 
 * Industry best practices 
 * Cultural values within DevSecOps in general and BrainGu in specific
