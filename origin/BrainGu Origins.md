In this document, we've collected photos from the original whiteboard sessions around the creation of BrainGu. This is, in a real sense, the essence of the foundation. Pictures include John Spencer, Matt Shaver, and Sunny Dasgupta. Photo credit, Matt Shaver.

## Creating BrainGu

**Spence:** This was us figuring out what the company would be at the point of greatest ignorance. The biggest thing that we wanted to see out of a company was that the people who were involved with it had ownership, autonomy, a say. The concept of the community of the company extends beyond the employees.

I want the trite things everyone says they want: to make the world a better place, etc. I want the work that I do and that my organization does to have positive impact. To me, that looks like positive impact on the community. We originally figured we'd only be working in Grand Rapids, but we’ve turned out to be more widespread geographically. I want us to be the place people get a chance. We have tried to truly be a meritocracy with regards to hiring. Many people who come to BrainGu don’t have traditional education backgrounds or experience. Other companies have come around to that. We are and have been consistently concerned about the brain drain in Michigan, which is a hard place to find a job that leverages your talents and learnings after you have a degree. This causes many people to move away to earn and fulfill themselves in the role they've sought out. We’ve also seen people decide to stay with family and be less fulfilled career-wise. I’d like for us to create opportunities for people to do their best and have an outlet for their creativity that's less geographically constrained.

**Matt:** Our motivation was seeing how restrictive large enterprise was in being able to have a change in process and technology. So we either ran into situations where a business wanted to invest 100% in tech with no process, or people just needed to work better. One main motivator for starting our own thing was, “let’s recognize the inertia that culture has once a company gets a certain size and has a certain following. Even with a great idea, it won’t change. So if you start with that basis, it’s better.”

</p>

**Spence:** These sessions were over months. Once a week, we got together at my house, around a table, with the whiteboard. Sometimes we’d all write on it, sometimes we’d have a scribe. Mostly we were relaxing, doing the thought work of “how would we reimagine what we’re seeing in the workplace right now to fit what we think would be higher impact? How would we govern ourselves? How would we be sustainable but not look like most businesses today?"

## Change the box

Even in the beginning, changing the box was key.

**Spence:** We struggle with these roots, where we want to upend the norm, but change the box to recognize some of the structures of large corporations that have value and merit. Profit-driven organizations have reasons to do XYZ. All the way back to our roots, we have this constant battle between our ideal vision, and our distaste for "Business as Usual." The core values really illustrate what we wanted to see, which was that impact is an additive thing, not a subtractive thing.

  </p>

**Matt:** “Revolution is necessary for survival.” We fully recognize that embracing change is paramount for success. In the industry since then, you’ve seen Agile, etc, don’t expect everything to be perfect. I’ve seen planning in waterfall for over a year, then dev in two years, and then you’ve solved nothing three years later. This is where building constant change as a core tenant is important. Agile was the industry’s natural response to accepting change. (fail fast)

## Living with passion

**Spence:** Living with passion is a recognition of the whole individual, much like [Spencelow's Hierarchy](https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/wiki/Spencelow%27s-Hierarchy-of-Bees), but also on recognizing work/life integration. We dont want a person to have to bring only a part of themselves to their professional life. To foster a community, we have to respect the intangible outcomes of people sitting together. These things don’t happen on a hangout.

**Matt:** We’ve always been focused on community involvement and awareness, so we considered being a B-Corp in 2008. We were looking at that instead of a C-corp, to make sure that community and environment were the principle there, were at the center of that. In reality, that doesn’t make sense when starting out as two people, with taxes and stuff. So we still went with LLC and membership.

We had this crazy concept where as a teambuilding event, you build your office. You rent power tools, and build your office. One of the things we were trying to get at with Live with Passion as a core concept &mdash; one of the key differentiators between us and other consultancies. We ingrain ourselves with the client rather than just understanding their needs, so we absorb their issues and concepts and thoughts and process, which allows us to use our experience to improve things. A lot of that comes with the passion for the work. If you’re trying to do that and you view your work as a 9-5 get your paycheck thing, it comes down to “at BG there shouldn’t be a work/life balance, because that gives a separation to living your life outside work. Instead, there should be a better quality of life. That comes with Live with Passion.” A lot of our guys err on the side of overworking themselves, not because of bonus or reputation, but because they’re really passionate about the work and its effect.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/blob/master/images/whiteboard/whiteboard_philosophy3.JPG" alt="The three main philosophies.">
  </p>

  **Matt:** Why start BrainGu? We want to be challenged. Regardless of the job, if you’re not changing and putting yourself in situations you're not prepared for, your job is to wake up in the morning and get it over with. So how you live with passion is to continually be challenged. We stay away from support work, and mundane stuff that may have good margins, but if you have someone who is truly exceptional, they need to be challenged and not be given simple problems.


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/blob/master/images/whiteboard/whiteboard_philosophy.JPG" alt="Creating operative philosophies.">
  </p>

  **Matt:** Every individual is qualified to contribute. This is the start of the flat organization, where we balanced a lot about how hierarchical we make it, because of the silos that that creates. Vault (gaming company) &mdash; every single person has the same vote. Their hiring process takes years. We wanted to build that concept where every individual is empowered to contribute. The reality is that people get overwhelmed just with the amont of info that goes through BrainGu, so hierarchies are more in place as a way of delegation and to assist in decisionmaking, but no one is limited from decisionmaking. So like, anyone can Slack anyone.

</p>

Clearly there were a lot of things to work out. And zombies.

**Spence:** There were many more whiteboards like this that didn’t get captured, because we’d write down the thoughts, and then organize it, and put it into something more organized. We’d take multiple passes over concepts. We’d take the picture, and then clean the whiteboard to take a more polished version. There’s a TV in that room, so it might be that we had a zombie movie in the background. Some of the process was “let the sillies flow” because, be who you are. But also, bottling up the silly makes people less focused.

We had conversations based on the assumption that we'd have a really well-built collaboration space. Rather than a conference room, we’d have more like WeWork. High chairs, standing level table, whiteboards on the walls, better lighting. Creativity/innovation would be critical to our success, and a workspace needs to provide that. Big spaces for big thoughts. When I lived in DC, I’d go to the courtyard at the [National Portrait Gallery](https://npg.si.edu/). When Matt and I went to do big strategic thinking, we toured the [cathedral in Cologne](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Cologne-Cathedral).
“Bad ass bio” &mdash; looking for everyone to write a thing about themselves.

</p>

**Matt:** Zombies are after BrainGu! The idea of products should have a free portion, open source and community-driven, but is released in a picky limited set to beta testers. That promotes our reputation, and then based off the reputation, we can provide integration, review, services. Quotes are not free &mdash; what’s free is the analysis of the community versions. If you want enterprise, we apply our methodology.


Not like all the other tech companies...

## Technology

Responding promptly because clients matter.

**Spence:** CommTech was important before we even started the company.
**Matt:** Check the manifesto about response times, etc. This was an intro to that.

</p>

## Community

**Spence:** All the way back to founding, we've wanted to leverage capitalism as a tool and not a weapon. How do we build diversity, equity, and inclusion in? These things are not tangible. What does respect look like in a conversation? We can disagree, respectfully, but we don’t know what we don’t know. And this is critical for us to be the company we want to be. If we want [self-actualization](https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/wiki/Spencelow%27s-Hierarchy-of-Bees), we need to know who someone is as a whole person. That’s really hard when workplace norms in America have been a certain way.

Most companies want to put their heads in the sand. I don’t think that’s who we should be. We’re going to have to take some risk and push into an uncomfortable place. I believe we’re behind the ball on this, but not as far behind as some. Hopefully we can close the gap with intention and certainty.

  <img src="https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/blob/master/images/whiteboard/whiteboard_community.JPG" alt="Grid of the BrainGu community.">
</p>

**Spence:** Community. Inside the shell/outside the shell uses “team” rather than “community”. Not the same, but relevant. Some engagement things we've done with other entities, like some of the D.C. nonprofit organizations, like Federation of Galaxy Explorers (STEM ed K-12). We have not been as formal in engagement with external members. Core members are shareholders now. Extended members are “employees." “Adjuncts” are contractors, etc. We have not directly interfaced with external members, mostly because of the history of being tied towards intel and being a bit more spooky. We didn’t even have a website in the beginning.

**Matt:** We never really did this. This was one of our ideas of how do we handle bizdev when the water hose fully turns on. So if you say, “OK give me 50 BG people” how do we manage that? Our solution back then was build this community of trusted people that can be spun up at any instance so that they get benefits as we get work, and then we have our core members lead those contractors to make sure that everything is still BG quality. If we do that, then those people are more likely to come back to us for our expertise, and that builds a reciprocal relationship. The problem we found was the details behind that. Getting biz patterns contracts set up, you can’t scale that way, and also make any margin to pay for the core members; it all goes to the contractors. It works if you’re not trying to build a business.

## Project management

Project management goes on forever.

**Matt:** This is terrible. Great ideas, but once you get into the details, it gets tricky. Company wide project teams… initial brainstorming is where the SMEs are. A project plan is less defined because we’re not accepting change. This is waterfall, and…. No.

</p>

## Meetings

**Matt:** I wish we implemented these meeting protocols. We’ve started using pomodoros. Most meetings are one pom/two poms. We havent’ forced it, companywide. Meeting cost calculator is an idea I’d love to implement. I wanted to build a Google Calendar plugin so that when you scheduled it, it calculated the cost of that meeting, based off of position.

</p>

## Documentation

**Matt:** We’ve made a lot of progress in p&p. This is pretty accurate, surprisingly. Hiring process is all coordinated through Slack.

</p>

## HR

HR processes show both the good news, and the bad.

**Matt:** We’ve kind of abandoned this idea of core + contractor. Due to growth, team involvement has gone down significantly; we mostly just trust the person hiring. We have an actual coding review.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/blob/master/images/whiteboard/whiteboard_hrprocedures.JPG" alt="HR procedures around hiring.">
  </p>

**Matt:** Seems pretty accurate. We have a whole PIP process. Employee counseling, that you have 30 days to shape up, or you get into a PIP, 2-3 month plan that has daily/hourly requirements, and if you don’t adhere, you get let go. Every person we’ve put through this has improved. They’re designed to make people better. “Harassment” is a bad category… more like “dealbreakers”. Those things don’t go through a PIP. Poor performance can be improved, dealbreakers can’t. Harassment, misrepresentation on your resume. We’re in an interesting time right now, with people. There’s a larger delta than before. It’s well within our predictions that this needs to be figured out from a process standpoint.

## Internal proecdures

Internal procedures? All over the map.

**Spence:** We agreed that you get a veto, a red card. If you use your veto, that’s a very serious thing. Generally, though, we move towards consensus. 100% consensus isn’t necessary, but within our current understanding of leadership, we defer to the Champion. If something has to happen now, we do what the Champion says. The CEO attempts to not put his finger on the scale in a way that’s detrimental to the “flat organization” life that we try to live. We do have structure, chain of command, but we only use it when we have to.

This weirds out clients who don't understand how we work, so we’ve stopped making it clear. We didn’t used to have a full-time CEO. I was the CTO; Matt was CEO. I didn’t use that authority &mdash; you just need to have one to open a bank account. And when we went from having a CEO on paper to having a full-time job role, it changed my interaction with the customers, even though it wasn't the kind of change they thought it was. In their organization, it’s a big deal. In ours, not so much.

**Matt:** This veto thing is still a thing. Think long term while protecting short term. Recognize the end goal. In the history of BrainGu it’s been done twice. The vetos were intended to be used if either of us (Spence or Matt) vehemently disagree, or ethically are not comfortable with our company doing that thing. It’s around decisions. If vetos are being used, there’s a pretty big disconnect between us, and whoever is making that decision. I think the biggest thing there, and why we went through the process of setting up the ethics board, is so that people recognize they have the right to do that. There are good and bad ways of doing it. Just throwing your hands up and refusing isn’t great, but if people run into something they’re uncomfortable doing, then they can come call us, and that’s what they should do.

</p>

**Spence:** The legacy of BrainGu will hopefully be building and facilitating a place for brilliant people to meet and have an outlet for that brilliance. Put smart people together and get good things out. And I think we have, in our way. We are doing good in the world.
