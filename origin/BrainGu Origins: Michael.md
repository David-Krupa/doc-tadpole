### A Tadpole Interview with Michael Kahn

There’s a pic of him at age four in front of an early Mac. For him, tech is ubiquitous.

He’s done code forever. Graduated from college in 2012. Worked at Harris — working with Spence on the predecessor to STOR. He’s interested in solving problems and figuring things out. Understanding how the systems work together and then pulling it apart.

From 2013-2016, he went from being entry level to being the lead on a 6-8 person team. Organic growth because as the team grew, he was already there. It was more a conscious transition to ladder climb.

He started when there were just five of them. He was pretty much doing software development on contract. But as it grew, he was doing tech lead stuff. Not just development, but customer relationship management, being on contract, talking to customers and understanding their needs. Towards the later half, he was doing a lot of tech lead work, but also upper management of customers. Proposal development and that kind of thing.

He’s pretty internally/externally congruent. He was on the board for a few years.

## Thoughts on Early BrainGu

### Financial growth

One of the big benefits of that first contract being a three-year federal contract where we were paid by the hour, was that if people were working, everything was getting paid. If people are working, they are generating the funds that pay them.

A challenge that BrainGu had was having one big contract pay all the bills. But there’s risk in diversifying. Hire new people and put them on a new project which fragments the company, or pull people from the sure thing to the new thing, so for sure a difficult transition.

After 2014, until 2016, we were confident enough in winning the recompetes that we weren’t super stressed about it. But if we’d lost that contract paying 80% of the bills, that would have been a problem. Otherwise, 2019 was a rough year; never had a time where all the long term contracts were going to be due at the same time, and there had always been a source of long term revenue. Not to say that’s enough to keep going.

One big lesson learned from 2015-2017 was that trying to sell a product in your free time without any sales people is not a practical way to build and sell a product. A lot of the lessons learned from working on that led into a lot of decisions around Structsure.


### Sociocultural growth

BrainGu was always a cybersecurity company, but Spence wanted to also make it a space company. That idea got pushed to the back due to the need to do what we do. 2014-2015, we knew we wanted to do more security work, but we’d do what we were paid to do.

It was difficult to market us, because customers didn’t really believe us when we said we’d do these things, because generally it takes a company of thousands to do that kind of work. So we would do whatever people would pay us to do. Eventually as we got bigger and could start thinking beyond six months out, we’d start thinking bigger picture. One of the goals was to move into the space industry, get contracts in that sector, and build products or do consulting in that area, but have that supported by the shorter-term goals. As part of that, Brent would have had a BrainGu core that was a labs/R&D shop, and a smaller # of people who’d come up with cool things would then spin them up; different divisions to do different aspects of things.

We had a lot of discussions about early scrappiness, because “I'll do whatever” doesn’t scale well. Certainly there are lots of people like that, but within the government contracting industry, it’s the antithesis of how that industry works.

While you’re small enough, that’s OK, but the way the industry is set up financially, if all you’re doing is contracting, the only way you make money is through scale. Even if you don’t want to turn into that soulless thing that matches resumes with RFPs, at a certain point, there aren’t enough people who want to just jump at whatever new problem, who have all the qualifications and price point, to work on government contracts. You want to hire the BrainGu labs person, vs hiring the person who can do the work that we have, that we need to grow. Always that point of decision, “do we separate these groups of people?” that has its own policies and setup.

Cross pollination? Or do we try to make everyone we hire be that kind of “looking for new problems all the time” person who can be put on any project, but is a lot harder to find with all the right clearances and certifications?

At best, you need to be able to rotate those people around.

In large part, the thing that keeps people attached to BrainGu is loyalty. At some point, it switches between, “you built something and you have responsibility and have some attachment to it beyond what you would to a regular job,” vs. “a job.” That point is somewhere between 15-20 people at the company. Before that point, people have seen how things got to be the way they were, and things were smaller and everyone knew each other well and had shared experiences. Past that point, it becomes harder, where you’re not all in the same office, there’s less of a tight attachment to that “thing” you’ve been building.

SitRep and retreats try to give everyone the chance to understand what the company is doing beyond whatever piece they’re working in.


### Technical Growth

When people were coming in, for a very long time, we were only hiring pretty experienced people. No new grads or anything like that, so they had experience with some toolsets coming in. Starting out, it was pretty much dictated by Spence who was running the only project we had. Those initial decisions drove a lot of what the rest of us found, researched, added. He (Michael) spent a lot of time working in Python and distributed frameworks. Sam worked on Puppet. Over time, as they understood the domains those tools were in, Sam would start using Ansible and Docker and Kubernetes, so they each specialized in specific areas and expanded those areas.

Spence drove a lot of the new tech at the beginning: whatever the new cutting-edge tool was that we thought would be useful in the future. There was some mentoring, some autodidacticism, when there was nobody around who knew it already. But we also learned a lot from each other and new people.

When he started on a few contracts, he knew how to write software, but had no idea about networking or network devices, or how to hook routers together. Things like that he mostly picked up by looking over someone's shoulder or asking questions and paying attention during meetings. So it was a mix of things he learned from people he was working with and fixing problems himself.

Researching problems online will not instill a sense of shared values. No guarantee, but more likely that if you’re working closely with someone who appreciates the BrainGu values and how they’re applied, whether or not there’s a formal explanation, you gain a lot of context from looking at how other people act and emulating them.

One of the big lessons we learned was the importance of planning and strategy and making conscious decisions instead of being reactive and only dealing with things as they show up. Only looking at the next two months doesn’t scale and certainly doesn’t provide a sense of security for people.

Early on, security was critical to BrainGu’s success. People were not as willing to jump into something brand new. Doing that when you know you have a steady paycheck is bigger than a promise of stock options.

We pushed hard decisions down the road, like thinking of strategies. A lot of companies will make decisions in their first year, and will have to be very deliberate, keep costs down, etc. Whereas if you have a predictable revenue stream, you can put those hard decisions down. He’s not sure what initial growth would have looked like without that steady growth — it allowed them to get more experience before hard decisions. That led to aversion to change, though, and not wanting to take on more risk, when normally you think the first year is riskless. The decision to bring in more risk happened after more people were onboard.

It makes it harder to take a risk when you know that not taking that risk is possible. But sooner or later something will catch up with you, whether a stable contract evaporates, or that you realize that the people have been doing the same thing and are ready to do something new but you don’t have a strategy in place to allow that move.

### BrainGu History/and your history

Software engineering/programming drove his affinity for this particular work — nerd hobbies in high school and did CS in college. But as far as getting into security/contracting side of things… he knew he wanted to work in projects with a bigger impact than clicking on ads.

He was interested in doing national security, contract stuff. Security in general, not any specific part of it. The problems around it and how it often involved lots of different factors: technical, environmental, social. He also did some privacy work in college; partly because he worked in the school newspaper, so he got the journalist ethics ethos. Also a friend was getting a Ph.D. in privacy/security.

He got into journalism because he was looking for things to do that didn’t involve computers. He joined as a copyeditor, edited the opinion section for a year, and edited the whole thing for a year. It was a low-ambition college paper. G20 came to Pittsburg and they took pictures. He took a few courses on privacy and security as electives, and intro to law, where he learned enough to know how much he didn’t understand. “Here’s how to think about complex problems”

His education background changed the way he codes. The Carnegie-Mellon curriculum is very theory-heavy. He approaches coding problems more from a “here’s how it works all down the stack. Because of the way that works, I can turn that knob and move that switch and this is how that will change.”

He thinks the editing work changed how he writes code, because he feels like he uses the same mental process. He has a mini-rant about how liberal arts people can be scared of programming and programming people are scared of books, and for him, it’s the same thing. If you can learn to do one, you can learn to do the other one. C-M required everyone to take one programming course as part of the curriculum. He knows a lot of friends in sciences or liberal arts who hated the course.

### Fundamentals

Understanding the fundamentals makes a big difference in how to solve problems, and how to understand other people's approach to solving problems. But understanding how a compiler works, at a high level, and understanding what happens in between you typing a line of code, and that code running on the machine, is really important for writing code that’s maintainable and performant. Why, not just how.


### Becoming Gu

His internship before senior year, he did at Booz-Allen. He knew the environment was changing, but he knew he didn’t want to do that. Enterprise PKI token implementations. Army contract, and extremely pentagon-adjacent and very slow-moving bureaucratic, political infighting. All the bad parts of govt contracts without any of the good.

Then he started working for Harris as his first real job, doing more technical-focused, security-related work. He was there for like 8-9 months. At the same time, Spence was tech lead on a contract for Harris that was essentially the contract they still have for STOR. Through various political maneuvers and working behind backs, Spence got him on the same contract. Spence knew someone in the corporate office, who knew Michael, and connected them and said “you should put him on your project”. There was a bunch of background political stuff he was unaware of.

He joined Spence’s team as an entry-level software engineer, with a team of 5-ish people. Stayed there for about a year, at which point the contract moved to BrainGu, and Spence and Sam and Brent joined, and we all joined BrainGu and started working on the same contract. BrainGu existed basically on paper for a few years before that, but in terms of revenue, that was the start of it.
