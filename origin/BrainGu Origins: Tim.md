## Tell me about your growing up, and your early experiences with tech.

Honestly didn’t have much interactions with tech growing up.  Didn’t have a family computer until I was around 10 and even then it was an AIO so there was nothing to open up and mess with.  And we didn’t get the internet until the early 2000s so I didn’t have a source to learn about this stuff.  Mostly just played with an NES and Genesis.

## What was your education like? Autodidactic, formal, university?

I got an associate degree and that was enough.  I quickly learned that colleges are too far behind in tech and the internet was a much better way to learn.

## How did you get into tech as a career?

I got into electronics via console games.  After that computer hardware just kind of came naturally.  My first job was setting up PCs.  I ended up learning new programming languages as my job evolved.

## How did you first encounter what became BrainGu?

I’ve known Spence since Kindergarten. We worked together at Commonwealth Associates, Inc (actually Gary Higbee did too) so he had a pretty good idea of what tech I knew at that point in time.  I was actually hesitant to join at first because the position was mostly Python which I only had very brief dealings with via Blender and Maya scripts.

## What do you consider to be your tech speciality?

Probably learning or debugging.  I tend to pick up new programming languages somewhat easily but that’s probably more to do with most popular languages being OOP and somewhat similar.  I also tend to think differently and can easily break things while debugging.

## Tell me about any hobbies or things you do outside BrainGu that would tell us more about how your brain works.

Drawing and game modding.

## Favorite books (both tech, and not tech)

I don’t read tech books.  Too far outdated and pointless.  Non-tech book would be Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

## Tell me about your role, and your contributions to BrainGu’s stability as a whole.

My original position was to fill in as a programmer so Spence could do other things.  And that’s where I’ve been until recently.


## Considering the volatility of a lot of developers, tell me about the mindset that underlies your ability to be the long-term guy who maintains continuity/consistency.

I’m not sure there’s a mindset to it.  I’m just doing my job to the best of my abilities.
