## Early Stuff

Grew up in a small town in middle-of-nowhere Michigan.


## High School

In high school, he was in the CAD program. That wasn't the troubleshooting he wanted. He did vocational for electronics and computer troubleshooting. Boolean logic to circuit design, etching, design, everything from the ground up. Always start at the bottom, the most base level, and then work your way up.

## College

*   He wanted to do computers and law enforcement, with a minor in homeland security (digital forensics). At college, he learned how to learn, and how to troubleshoot and fix things. Given a problem, told to figure it out, fill in the blanks for yourselves and we’ll help you when you get stuck. They told you where to look to find the answer. Jared DeMott was his adjunct professor.
*   First two years pure networking Cisco academy. CCNA — 140 kids in the class. First thing the teacher said was, “half won’t pass.” In four years, three graduated within that time. Pretty aggressive.
*   After networking, digital design/circuits stuff. Close with the electrical engineering program. Colab to build and design and publish together. Didn’t start programming until their junior year. Had to take pic processors and program with HEX.
*   8086s on breadboard and assembly, then C, then realtime OSs, then more in depth as to how computers work.
*   Forensics, he walked in knowing more than the professor. He didn’t represent himself well. Mix between criminal justice and tech, and he ended up explaining stuff to the criminal justice kids.
*   Did lots of his own studying on forensics to make up.
*   Faculty tech support for 3 years. Got to help professors and labs with their stuff. How can we speed up and automate and make stuff more efficient? Design and reimage labs.
*   He supported the medical teams. Unique apps and software and machines. Accommodate and interface with those machines, whether ports, filter mac addy, set up secure systems.


## Internships, and Beyond

*   Internship in Columbus with DFAS accounting
    *   Running on COBOL. He’d never experienced this before, had to learn it. They gave him the task to find empty tables and delete on approval.
*   Interviewed with XETRON. Worst interview ever. Flew him to Cincinnati. Interview all day. Switched out with a new person every hour.
*   Crucial Security — bought by Harris. Very small company feel. How he problem solves and approaches rather than what he knew. If he was unclear, they’d ask him to explain and then apply. Moved to Virginia.
    *   Forensics. First project was to take a microcontroller, custom USB device, would do different things. If boot, it would recognize BIOS and mount a different partition. He had to write an app that when it was booted, would load a keyword list in memory, search recursively through drive, find a file, and then scrape files, and find keywords, as fast as it could on any computer it was plugged into. Filtration system for door kickers in the military who find computers in the field.
    *   Presented at conferences and with customers doing live demos. Never got sold.
*   A few of the guys who interviewed him asked him if they gave him an app, could he tell them what port it’s listening on.
*   Given an app, he was told to reverse engineer and write it up. No formal training, no experience, he just did the thing. Got scope increased to look at the web interfaces as well. So then they dug through that tooling. Wrote a proof of concept for a web scraper. They restructured the contract to use that tool at the time. Thick client is not as useful; web app is best. Make it do more! That program is still running and executing today. And that was seven years ago.
*   Culture there had drastically changed because of the takeover by Harris. Crucial Security folks were nice and really good at what they did, and good about answering questions. From that to corporate, and it became stagnant, with them stripping benefits away. He felt less appreciated, less like he was in a cohesive team. Didn’t feel great any more.


## To BrainGu

*   He had worked with Spence and Sam at Crucial/Harris. He went to ManTech. Didn’t enjoy it as much as he thought he would. ManTech was a lot more cocky, less of a learning group. He didn’t really fit in. At Harris, he got sent home for a week without pay because of the government sequester. Almost a year later, it happened at ManTech. ManTech was good for technical growth, but not a culture fit. He wasn’t advancing in the ways he wanted to. He worked the early shift, so he’d get there 6-6:30.
*   Then, he started at BrainGu (Bushido).
*   STOR59 — first big project, malware analysis system, writing tools for binary analysis. Wrote a dozen different tools for file analysis, handling and analyzing PDFs, etc. One of the things they had to do was deploy rapidly and frequently, so he had to find and develop all these ways to deploy packages rapidly. RPMs from Python. Kept tweaking and got more efficient. That was before K8s and Istio. They were setting the pace and doing groundbreaking stuff they couldn’t share because all government stuff. Commercial caught up later.
*   Still have STOR132, which is the recompete for STOR59. Did a lot of cool stuff on those. Programming to operational support. Got to help the people doing actual things. Maintaining control and knowing who’s using your stuff. With ManTech, he had a good idea of how it was going to be used, but no control and no insight as to where it would go. No guarantee about what would happen next.
*   If you manufacture a bullet, are you liable for it? Lots of different opinions and views in the company about ethics. He has his set lines. Who he does what type of work for. No offensive work for any non-US entities. Even in the US, not going to do offensive capabilities towards US citizens.
    *   He’s had confirmation that his stuff has ended up killing people.
    *   He’s always stood up for people who are uncomfortable for any particular work.
*   On STOR for 6-7 years. The opportunity came up when they were approached by a friend from Harris. Then they won their first work. Two years ago, they recompeted, won again. Potentially one more year.
*   Backfilled his tech role, but kept his lead role.
*   Bouncing between 3 different projects — Muddogs, Sudoku, Widow.
    *   Muddogs. He does project planning ticketing, tasking and code reviews for widow
    *   Widow — code and tickets
    *   Sudoku — reference, best practices
    *   AFSO for BrainGu (5 years). Anything Spence can’t handle, like hiring, he submits for ISI to process their clearances or new clearances.
    *   Culture sprint team
    *   Employee rep for the Mgmt Advisory Board. “Canary vibe” — he adjusts Spence for tone.
    *   Early steering
        *   Unhappy with Harris, so they talked about different stuff. “This would be cooler than that”. Then when Spence mentioned coming over, he explained a lot of his concerns. Company tailored for the employee, not vice versa. Big picture wishing well kinds of things.
            *   Intellectual property boundaries.
    *   He likes working in lower level systems not web, alas.
*   Spence asked him what he wanted to do, but that’s a difficult question to answer. I know what would make me satisfied with my workday. It doesn’t matter what I do as long as it makes a big impact for my customer. I like to take down the badges. Good fast cheap, pick two. Is it really impactful? Does it catch the bad guys, does it make the world a better place, does it make us money?
*   Is it really cool?
    *   Things he would brag about if he could. Something that is challenging, may not have been done before, unique solving things. How it helps the customer’s missions.
    *   Traveling to another country to help out with investigations and stuff. New experience, and a unique thing.
    *   Got asked to help to do red team on live ops.
    *   Writing programs that scale and automate, and getting the response that “we didn’t know that was possible!”
    *   Digital red teaming. Beating the bad guy without being a bad guy is the draw. Risk averse mind — excel at troubleshooting and breaking things.
