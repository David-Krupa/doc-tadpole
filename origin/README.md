Welcome to BrainGu! We're so glad you joined us!

BrainGu's' Founders (John Spencer, Matt Shaver, Michael Kahn, Brent Johnson, Sam James, Tim Weeks) have taken the time to tell the stories of how BrainGu started out, and how each of them approaches technology in their own unique way. This wiki exists to capture that knowlege, and share it with you, in the hopes that you'll be more able to engage with this place.

The main navigation of this wiki tells the same story, but in alphabetical order, which might not make as much sense to you, if you're just starting out on the Great Adventure that is BrainGu. The right nav in this section is arranged as a narrative.

We sincerely hope you enjoy the ride.
