## Spence and Matt Meet

Spence and I met at a middle school tech club. Spence was in high school, so he was the lead, and he came down with a few folks to the middle school to teach tech. We became friends after I corrected him. Spence was quizzing the class on how to rename a file. Right click, rename… and I said “that seems weird, why would you teach that when you can press F2?”  Spence said we shouldn’t be teaching shortcuts.

When Matt went to high school, he was a freshman and Spence was a senior. Spence played snare drum. He had been planning on getting into band, and Spence talked him into cymbals. He learned a lot about drumming. Their high school experience is him holding cymbals for Spence during football games and parades and Disney World’s parade. They mostly did the normal highschool thing — played video games and hung out


## College and Beyond

After that, we kept in contact. Spence went to MSU for biology. I went to Grand Valley, in computer science. So we started college together as freshmen, ish, after Spence’s four year hiatus.

In college we did everything together. Alex and Spence were roommates for a long time. Alex is married to Spence’s sister. Tim Weeks was in high school with Spence.

During that whole time, Spence was working full time and going to college, and I was working at Amway, which became a full time internship every summer of college. Spence got tired of driving from Grand Rapids to Jackson, so I got him a job at Amway. The internship didn’t go well for Spence, because he got mono and was out for the majority of it. When Amway was going to give Spence an offer, he got an offer from Shane (longtime friend) to work at Crucial security.

He was managing Amway’s global web enterprise across 50 countries. Web dev, biz intel. He had been doing that, graduated, applied for a senior position and got it, and then they made him the offer for a junior position. He was full time, running 20 offshore devs. He took the position just to have a job, but started looking. Applied at KPMG. Amway offered him $40K. He applied at KPMG, and they gave him $90k. He realized then that his strategy of asking a ridiculous amount wasn’t ridiculous.

He worked his way up, doing enterprise dev, very commercial-side heavy. Spence was doing cyber. Got promoted to manager, and managed a team there over a $35million line of business. It was all politics. Got tired of the red tape.


## BrainGu

They dreamed up BrainGu. The idea there was that Spence would lead cybersecurity, Sunny would lead the business side, Matt would do commercial. Cyber, healthcare, education, Space, and social services. They made the plans a month before the market crashed. So they decided they had the groundwork, but waited to revisit until things stabilized. Spence went Crucial/Harris, until 2012. They got their first opportunity in 2012 partnering with Deloitte. Sunny wasn’t in a position to quit his job, so he worked out with Spence that Spence would consult with Harris. Spence did direct consulting, pooled that money, and those funds started BrainGu.

He (Matt) then quit his job at Amway, and he worked for minimum wage off that $50K, and then got BrainGu commercial clients, just to get money into the business. SharePoint, Salesforce, custom development. Got a reputation in the freelance community for being able to build stuff really quickly. That got him to have an agreement with Topcoder, with a director, so then he did stuff for BestBuy, Coke, AmEx. That director went to Accenture, so they did work for Appirio (who purchased Topcoder). Then they got more contracts for Discovery, JPMorganChase, etc, and then from that point, that led us to 2019. Last project with Appirio was with American Cancer Society.


## Where We’re At Now

We’re perfectly happy with how things ended up. Some commercial projects have good mission (Brent triangle). From the ground up, we changed how American Cancer Society did donations, event management, driving patients to doctors, their entire infrastructure. We rewrote it all. The project was led by Appirio, but we did all the work. There’s a lot of mission value in there, but we want to be more focused than just “commercial”. We want to be more focused on sectors, not just “commercial.” We also have to recognize we were a little foolish to think we could go after the large sectors as one business. Nobody has a standard process for how contracts work — it’s different in every sector. Lesson learned is that they’d be different Gu businesses once we got there.

Glass ceiling approach to promotions. If you have smart, innovative, creative people, entrepreneurial people who want to grow the company, those are the people you invest in. But! They reach a point where they’ve reached the highest they can go without leading BrainGu. As a project reaches maturity, BrainGu becomes its own angel investor as those companies split off (beyond incubator, it empowers peo[pel at high levels to keep going but also to stay associated. You want to go start your own company? Great. Start a BrainGu company. We’ll set you up, we’ll be partial owners, and you go do it.
