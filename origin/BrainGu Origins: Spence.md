## Q: How did you get into tech?

As a young kid, he was taking things apart and putting them back together, which made his parents upset. He wanted to understand how pieces come together to be a whole. Then he got to use computers in a lot of places. When his grandfather retired, he got to bring home a TI 994A (stored data on cassette tape), and Spence learned programming in BASIC. He was sure it was a video game, and eventually, Grandpa sat him down, and showed him how to “play” in BASIC when he was 10. He didn’t really grasp some of the more intricate concepts, but started to understand program flow, and variables.

A few years later he got a computer at home. He broke and fixed it, hardware and software both, using the terminal and DOS prompts. His other grandparents got an Apple II, which was a whole different experience, and different kind of scripting. He started to accumulate information about what was the same, and what was different.

It was a great time to learn, because the state of computing at the time allowed for a more diverse experience than now. You had to touch the command line to make it do anything &mdash; earlier wouldn’t have been fun, later would have had software available that provided more hand holding.

The next iteration was getting the internet at home, because so much information was available (this was around maybe 1999-ish). His mom worked at the University, and he used the internet there. So they decided to get it at home. His mom also printed out an HTML manual; he spent a bunch of nights and weekends toying with that. A year later he got a book about C++, and he didn’t have a compiler, so he read the book and thought about it, but didn’t know how to close the loop between that and the other thing.

That summer he got a job repairing cell phones. At first, it was cleaning plastic pieces, lenses, screens. Then he was reprogramming the phones to be factory fresh. Getting shocked by testing boards. Finding the fun ways electronics can fail.

The summer after that, his Mom stopped working at the University (of Michigan), and started working at a company that had an IT internship (electrical engineering firm). They had no dedicated staff. So he got that job, worked there that summer, and every summer after that, he was the IT Help Desk guy. They didn’t even let him in the server room for a while. He spent his time imaging new computers, and troubleshooting.

Eventually, they let him spend more time in servers, offered him a full time gig after high school, and agreed to partially pay for college. However, the company grew fast and work came first, which competed with college. There were a few classes he either failed or had to drop. Really had to work with the professors about being flexible. The company grew 6x in 3 years, and he was the first full time IT guy at 18. As the company scaled and grew and needed more time, the engineers had to focus on growth, so he got more authority. So over the course of that time he led the migration of email, telephone, bare metal to virtualization. Lots of sysadmin stuff up to 2005. Around there, with all the growing, they company he worked for could not sustain their paper timecard process.

He convinced them it would make more sense to program a new system rather than buy one. It gave him a ton of opportunity to learn and build a production system. He missed his 21st birthday because he was fixing the system so payroll went out.

He presented tech options and project plans to the execs and the board. He learned a ton about not only tech, but delivering decision-making info to leadership and those processes. He learned most of that the hard way.

He sat down with the VP, and the VP tore him one, about the first IT budget he presented that was over $1Mil. “When we started this business, we didn’t have any computers, and now we have to spend 10% of our revenue on computers???” Somewhere between young and naive, and cocky, he reacted differently than he would later. Now, he understands that this is exactly the way to make the argument, and he shouldn’t have shown him the shocking number without the backstory. Get him before the emotional reaction hits, not after. He learned a lot about how not to run a business, and how to navigate fraught relationships but still get IT delivered. This was a crucible of an experience. He quit because he realized he’d never graduate if he stayed there, and then went on to finish school at Grand Valley State, in MI, where Matt went as well, and Ashley too. Many of BrainGu’s summer interns, in fact. Brent and Sam went to Ferri (an hour north).


## Q: How did you decide to create BrainGu?

In the last semester in college, he got a job where Matt was, at Amway. They were sure they wanted to start a business then. Spence’s dad is an entrepreneur. He did the same thing; learned from work at factories, what matters to who, and then realized he could run this. At home and growing up, being your own business owner wasn’t considered risky; it was normal. He saw his own family be more successful after the entrepreneurial route. So it just seemed like the better way to go.

They were graduating in 2010. That was not an ideal time to start a new biz. He had a job offer to work for the Harris Corporation, and Matt to KPMG. They shelved the Gu idea because it’d be good in several years. So they got experience at bigger companies, played it safe for a bit. That’s what got him into the defense arena. He moved to the Washington DC area, and got some perspective. The Harris Corporation was filled with some of the best hackers in the world; nice people, really talented. Not a single person he would go have lunch with that hadn’t spoken at Black Hat or DEF CON or ten other conferences — cream of the crop. With an acquisition, the culture changed and monetization mattered, so some of those folks with creative compensation plans got jerked around, and slowly moved on.

At that point, he had a client he was working with that had a big need — malware and incidents were outpacing what you could respond to with human analysis. In talking to the client and understanding this, he realized they were going to have to use automation. You saw people with PhDs doing scutwork. The trick is, that company made money on staffing more people. A lot of government work is “bodyshopping”. The acquisition process is bent so you don’t profit off the government, but you can get your profit off more individuals. He realized the model was inside out. The fact that you couldn’t hire more people to solve the problem, and the government can’t afford it anyway, means it’s not a business problem.

He pitched to his VP at the time. They were like, “he’s not allowed to talk to the customer any more. You don’t know anything about how to do business. Stay in your lane.”  He decided to quit that day. He didn’t want to be one of the bodies in their quantity game, when he was sure you could play a quality game and have a bigger impact on the outcomes.

He interviewed in a lot of places. He quit, and consulted for a while. He was talking to Matt, who was consulting on the side, and supplementing his income, keeping his options open. Both of them saw the opportunity to solve the problem.

The government wouldn’t take a chance on upstart him starting a business. So since they could not get a contract directly, they started shopping to some of the other big companies, subcontracting for a while to build business maturity.

They were “engineering first,” and fairly naive about business. They sort of had to find out that sometimes people were lying.


## Q: How do you think about what you’ve built/are building?

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/blob/master/images/brainguvision.png" width="500"></p>

They didn’t always have the word “businesses” in the vision. For BrainGu to truly be sustainable, the technology had to solve a need with a value proposition that put paychecks in bank accounts, and gave them the ability to buy the tools/software/hardware that they needed to make the innovation happen.


## Q: What’s your recruiting vision for scalability?

As we scale the business, there is a component of things you _are_ innovating, and things you _innovated_. For things you are innovating, you need generalist, chaos-tolerant people. Once it’s past tense, you need different people to maintain the progress. Sometimes you want a generalist who is just a little less experienced, or a specialist who is really going to be able to harness that system or drive additional skills into it. 0-1 vs 1-10.

As a startup, we need chaos tolerant generalists, but as the chaos reduces, someone who is chaos tolerant gets bored. Then you get low morale and discontent.

In a way, BrainGu was a one-project company for a long time. And when political winds shifted, we had to go find our own innovations. For some older projects, we’re starting to solve the same problems over and over. (similar, but not precisely same.) So due to the morale impact of this, if we want this saved, and to innovate, it’s his job to go find hard problems and dollars, to feed these brains new stuff to crunch on. That’s what led to the pivot to AFWERX and SBRs.
