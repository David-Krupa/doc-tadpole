## 2008

*   Initial discussions
    *   4 partners: 2 business, 2 compsci
    *   Focus on small to medium business providing 6 “service products” for combining business process and technology to solve pressing organizational needs.


## 2009

*   The team determines market risk is too high given the current economy, and the idea is shelved in favor of taking stable jobs after graduation.


## 2010

*   Dormant


## 2011

*   Dormant


## 2012

*   Spence and Matt begin talking about a highly technical, cybersecurity company focused on Fortune 500 and US Government customers. Later that year, they form the legal entity for BrainGu and begin to seriously explore options.


## 2013

*   Employee Count 01/01/2013 - 0
*   BrainGu lands its first commercial contract and Spence starts as a full-time employee. Several other short-term commercial engagements begin to come in and one federal contract. They work hard on partnerships and recruitment to pursue a more steady, long-term federal contract. After gaining commitments, they submit their first bid and are awarded a 3-year federal contract with significant room for further growth. By the end of the year, Matt has started as a full-time employee, bringing with him a significant commercial client.
*   Employee Count 12/31/2013 - 2


## 2014

*   Employee Count 01/01/2014 - 2
*   The team pours their energy into stabilizing the business processes and transitioning in new staff. There is a big push to gain a second federal contract, which ultimately was awarded to the incumbent. Many lessons were learned and the team solidified around growing technically and migrating in staff that had been incubating in partnerships.
*   Revenue: ~$350,000.00
*   Employee Count 12/31/2014 - 4


## 2015

*   Employee Count 01/01/2015 - 5
*   All incubated staff are finally, officially BrainGu and the team added another full-time member to the primary contract. A major commercial client chose to drop most of its contractors. While BrainGu’s quality and reputation helped us make the cut, the client significantly reduced orders, leaving the company with only one major source of revenue. At the end of the year, the partners begin working on a strategy for diversification and growth — starting with a major investment in product R&D. (Thus is born, Doormouse)
*   Revenue: ~$1,120,000.00
*   Employee Count 12/31/2015 - 8


## 2016

*   Employee Count 01/01/2016 - 8
*   Things
    *   Recompete
    *   Split out Doormouse
    *   FCL
*   Employee Count 07/13/2017 - 9 + 1 intern


## 2017

*   More strategically driven: Space + “Cyber” business expansion
*   Structsure


## 2018

*   Product team
*   Executive team (CEO, VP, DirEng)
*   Added second major prime
*   Data integration, anything and everything to build up a client list.


## 2019

*   Ouch
*   This was a turning point for us.
*   (Spence) We lost our anchor revenue on the commercial side. We tried to regain our balance and weren’t able to. We laid off the commercial side, refocused our efforts on federal customers and cleared work. We were able, through Structsure, to go get access to AFWERX (June) — something we’d been working on for a year (since the middle of 2018). That was a giant change for us, and a door opener. Gave us the opportunity to be a prime, and to prove ourselves as a standalone company. Really in the last month of the year we got Sudoku, and saw it was going to work out.
*  (Matt) Commercial client screwed us over, so shut that down. We had eight people on the commercial side, $2.5 million contract agreed to. The company was acquired, and BrainGu was still delivering for that client, new contract in March. Once they finished the February project, they said, “since we were bought, our agreement is no longer valid." So either legal battle, or find new work (more than what we were doing). Lack of clearances were an issue. And we didn’t have backup commercial plans, because we thought we had that set up for those eight people. We had enough in reserves to keep those people benched for three months. So we called in every favor they had over two months to get billable work for them, and if we didn’t have anything, we had to let folks go.
*   There were lots of lessons learned about business development. To minimize risk, we stopped the commercial business, so we could double down on federal work. One sales pipeline, one type of approach. That way if a contract were to be suddenly closed, we can shift people over. The fruit of that change happened this year, because we had a$1.5mil project taken out suddenly due to a contract mess up. Muddogs. Those three folks just moved onto different projects.
*    It made us more risk averse, and we’ve gotten a little better. You overcorrect from that kind of event. We’ve gotten better on not hiring too many people, so that we’re not overtaxed or overburdened. But… there’s a loss of opportunity there too. Every unfilled seat is also a missed opportunity of revenue, and what they can do. It’s a bounce we’ll always have to go back and forth on.



## 2020

*   Significant growth
*   How do we manage, sustain, and function in that level of growth?
*   Holding on for the ride. Until now, where we’re trying to put wings on this thing and start flying it, instead of just letting it take us for a ride.
*   We had cut all of our support staff, all vendors, everything down to bare bones. We tightened the org to account for going back to a smaller ops footprint. Then suddenly they had to grow faster than ever, and there was so much opportunity, and we had let go of some great devs and biz people. Getting back to where we could accommodate growth was incredibly difficult and chaotic. It was not deliberate, it was very reactive, and not expected. We anticipated another 18 months of struggle before we got cash positive. We had a path to health and it was going to be slow and methodical and not fun.
*   AFWERX —  it was a surprise to them that stuff we’d been doing for years was stuff they really needed. Those phone calls and the waiting. Then suddenly it was on and they had to go do it.  The day after Thanksgiving, they called to start the contract.
