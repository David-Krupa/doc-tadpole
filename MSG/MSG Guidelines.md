# MSG Guidelines

Welcome to the Mission Systems Group.

The first guideline is that we believe in continuous improvement. So if you think something should be changed or added, make it happen!

## Common JIRA Tickets
Which ticket is the right one to log your time?

**Talent Acquisitions/Recruiting** [BG-273](https://braingu.atlassian.net/browse/BG-273) - Time spent reviewing candidates in Greenhouse, interviewing candidates, and attending recruiting meetings

**BrainBudget Requests** - See the [BrainBudget Guide](https://github.com/braingu/doc-tadpole/blob/master/ADR/ADR%20003%20-%20BrainBudget.md) - This is where you create your BrainBudget ticket. Which you will also log any time spent during work hours.

**MSG-Directed Training** [LD-375](https://braingu.atlassian.net/browse/LD-375) - Company-directed training is mandatory coursework and does not come out of your BrainBudget. Your supervisor will inform you how much time during work hours you should spend on company-directed training.

**Lunch & Learns (Non-Billable)** [LD-374](https://braingu.atlassian.net/browse/LD-374) - MSG Lunch & Learns which are not billable to your project. If your lunch & learns are baked into your billable project, you'll have a project-specific code.

**Gu Leadership Development Group** [BG-80](https://braingu.atlassian.net/browse/BG-80) - Our end-of-week meeting where we discuss the big questions about leadership and tap into the 1000-year old mind. Also used for other cross-squad issues by the Squad Leads.

What about **SITREP**?
SITREP isn't mandatory, so there's nothing to log. The first thing we do is have a drink check. It's a fun time to gather and get the latest news. Unless you're assigned to present something at SITREP. In which case you log the thing you're presenting.
