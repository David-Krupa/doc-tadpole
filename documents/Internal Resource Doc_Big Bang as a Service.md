# Big Bang as a Service Internal Resource
## DevSecOps Platform Enabling Mission-Focused Software Factories
Big Bang as a Service is our solution offering that combines our ability to set up custom Big Bang instances and our support service DevX to make building a Big Bang software factory easy.  
### What Is Big Bang?
A framework for deploying DevSecOps Platforms that are compliant with the DoD DevSecOps(DSO) Reference Design, for Commands who need to build and run mission applications.
- An Umbrella Helm Chart that leverages IronBank Container Images
- Designed to be installed on a pre-existing Kubernetes Cluster
- Installed and managed using GitOps and Infrastructure as Code
### The BrainGu Approach
The journey to transitioning from an existing legacy software solution to a Cloud-Native/DevSecOps solution can be difficult. We succeed in technology disruption because we respect the importance of the value that legacy technology brings. We do this by approaching existing customer software development teams where they are at in their Cloud-Native journey; recognizing their current maturity in culture, process, and technology. Then, we evaluate the critical gaps, seeking a chain of “smallest change, biggest impact” tweaks that we can bring to them in a phased approach. 
### Pricing

### Big Bang as a Service Offerings
#### Select Clusters
Select the type of cluster you need. Is this a brand new development project? Are you modernizing an existing application? Do you just need a secure place to test or a production environment to operate your already DSO-compliant applications? BrainGu offers DoD DSO Reference Design compliant clusters to accommodate these and much more.
- Development tools
- Mission App Production
- Mission App Staging
#### Select Networks
Select the network(s) where you need to operate. Through the adoption of Platform One’s Big Bang into the core of BrainGu’s Structsure product, Structsure can be deployed at all three classification levels and fully disconnected networks.
- ISO/IEC 27000
- U.S. FedRAMP
- NIPR/SIPR/JWICS
- Medical/Health
- NATO
- Intelligence
- Disconnected networks
#### Select Support Level
Select your support level. Will you only need support during “business hours” or do you need real-time 24x7 support for your mission?
- Standard Support (business hours, 5 days a week)
- Mission Critical Support (24/7)
#### Select Upgrades
Add upgrades such as High Availability, Disaster Recovery, and more at any time.
- High Availability
- Disaster Recovery
### What is DevX
DevX brings a team of DSO experts to support the customer’s software teams to better deliver code by lowering the barrier to entry. If you are currently dependent on traditional development practices DevX will provide practical hands-on recommendations, guidance, and specialized operational support for your existing development teams that are looking to bring their code and workloads to a DSO Platform. 
### Additional Talking Points
- Experience in standing up multiple Big Bang instances for customers in the USAF and Army provided development collaboration tools, CI/CD pipelines, and development, staging, and production deployment targets. 
- We can build enhancements to the Big Bang baseline to add flexibility and configuration options to work in non-traditional environments such as AC2SP, on-premises deployments, and standalone air-gapped networks. 
- For Army INSCOM we refined the IaC/CaC which allowed us to repeatedly deploy hundreds of iterations of Big Bang across different AC2SP VPCs.
- We built the Unified Platform Mission System Kubernetes infrastructure to meet the needs of the LevelUP Software Factory and Unified Platform. 
  - This system is known as ClusterUP and is a fully compliant DoD DevSecOps reference design system that is in production today.
