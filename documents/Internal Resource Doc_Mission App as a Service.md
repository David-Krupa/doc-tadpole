# Mission App as a Service Internal Resource Document
## Rapid application development at the speed of relevance.
We deliver custom DevSecOps software at the speed of relevance with a focus on exceptional user experience. Mission Apps as a Service(MAaaS) puts operators side-by-side with world-class BrainGu software engineering teams. This hand-in-hand approach ensures modern and secure development. The MAaaS team steps through Day 0 (prototype & demo), Day 1 (pilot & exercise), to finally Day 2 (production & combat), at the fastest optempo possible and is aligned directly to customer mission needs.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: We need to be clear with the customer that we are selling products, not levels of effort. We are not providing developers for 3 months, during which time we will create whatever the customer asks for. We are delivering a product, for which the MVP will be completed in 3 months’ time. 
### The BrainGu Approach
The journey transitioning from an existing legacy software solution to a Cloud-Native/DevSecOps solution can be difficult. We succeed in modernization because we respect the value that legacy technology brings. We do this by approaching existing customer software development teams where they are at in their cloud native journey. We recognize their current maturity in culture, process, and technology. Then we evaluate the critical gaps, seeking a chain of “smallest change, biggest impact” tweaks that we can implement in a phased approach.

### Mission App as a Service Offerings
#### Building Blocks (a la Carte)
Yearly commitment subscription paid either monthly, quarterly, or annually.
We work directly with operators to evaluate the scope of their app and determine success criteria for the application to be developed. BrainGu experts are on hand to help customers determine core/critical and additional features that will contribute to the development of the application.
#### End-to-End App Development
From ideation to production within one year. BrainGu developers will work side-by-side with operators to deliver applications that meet your mission-critical needs. Pricing varies based on the stage of the application development.
### Additional Talking Points
- Software factories allow the DoD to leverage the best of Silicon Valley DevSecOps rapid technology development.
- Software factories ensure that applications are secure, and developed with the contextual understanding of the needs of the operators in the field.
- BrainGu leverages government code, DevSecOps best practices outlined in the DoD DSO reference architecture, and the same Big Bang tech stack as Platform One. 
### Development Cycle
#### Day 0 - Prototype/Demo
- MVP delivered in 3 months
#### Day 1 - Pilot/Exercise
- Additional feature sets built out for operator needs
- 6 - 8 month cycle
#### Day 2 - Production/Combat
- Application handoff to the customer
- Application sustainment
### Mission Applications
**SPLAT** is a mission systems comprehensive survivability dashboard for U.S. Air Force test and evaluation exercises. This mission application is comprised of multiple widgets allowing the user to analyze aggregated data to answer three questions: Can I see a threat? Can the threat see me? Do I know if they see me?
**Maize (mah-eez)** is a prototype dashboard and toolkit that utilizes machine learning and human intelligence to track and target threat narratives, enable response options based on attack vectors/actors, and assess impacts using publicly available information. Maize reduces the response timeline from months to days.
**LIFTT** is an event management and data tracking portal for the USAF operational test and evaluation (OT&E) aircrew and community. It facilitates exercises and test events, primarily Orange Flag. LIFTT employs participant and administrator workflows that allow users to manage events including creation, registration, logging of assets and capabilities, tracking of objectives, and monitoring of data collection and transfers.
**Achilles** was created to ingest health data from operators in order to support the USAF’s readiness. Achilles identifies illnesses before they register as an impact to operational readiness. It consolidates personal health data from several types of health monitoring devices and applications into a single dashboard to summarize overall troop readiness to commanders. 
**Venom** is an application that dynamically shows threats in all domains. In a single view, all threats can be visualized and compared against blue all-domain effects. The completed product will show the gaps and seams in a particular kill-web and show the gained effects from current blue capabilities. Operators will be able to plot enemy capabilities and adjust flight patterns to avoid danger areas.
**WIDOW** is built in close partnership with tactical level operators that use it every day. This mission application supports collaborative, distributed, real-time mission planning in order to achieve more lethal outcomes. BrainGu utilizes modern DevSecOps processes and works closely with operators, both on and off the field, in order to implement feedback at speeds warfighters have never seen.
