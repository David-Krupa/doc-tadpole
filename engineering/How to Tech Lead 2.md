### A Tadpole Interview with Richard Autry


## What does the mentoring process look like from your point of view?

*   He communicates with his team in Slack, and Matt is on those channels. He gives feedback there, like “a team member is struggling” based on code push and feedback. He doesn’t come to standups as much, and in general, he just tries to share what he’s done in their 1:1, and Matt points out talking points to make sure folks are developing over time.
*   Client interaction just started recently. More of a slow boil, compared to managing his team.


## What things did you already understand? How were you already predisposed to tech lead roles?

*   He’s been managing in some kind of role since he was 19. He always gets thrown into it. You can’t expect to know more than all of your team, and if somebody proves they have a better understanding of something, let them take the lead on that part of the project. You can’t be a micromanager or dictator; you have to let people who know more than you work on the project and make mistakes.
*   Having an aptitude for helping people or finding a weak point in someone’s skill set and steering them towards resources that will help — not having the answers, but helping people past a blocker or obstacle. You have to want to help your team. You have to want them to develop and not have to come to you for every problem they’re having. Autonomy.



## What things have you learned about the tech lead process that are new?

*   How involved you have to be with your team. His style has always been “get them trained up and let them do it on their own,” and he’s been surprised at how involved he needs to be with his team. Syncing up once or twice a week isn’t working, so it’s got to be once or twice a day. This is mostly because there are juniors who need to actively learn/are actively learning, so you can’t assume they know everything, but also the pace of our current contract. We have really hard deadlines, and for tech it’s pretty fast-paced. Sometimes with engineers specifically, if you let them deal with a problem on their own, they will take as long as they want with it, so setting strict deadlines is important. Here, daily tasks are more ambiguous.


## What kinds of red flags has Matt been able to point out to  you?

*   Someone was saying that they’re “chugging along” on the problem, and he said, that’s a synonym for “I’m struggling and blocked” especially for juniors, and they need more help.
*   For the client, he hasn’t been involved enough to quite understand what flags may be coming up. He mostly interacts with Slack, and issues have been easy to spot. Errors in production, but you have to expect errors in the agile process.


## What kinds of resources have you used to educate yourself? Books? Articles? The booklist? TED talks?

*   From a technical standpoint, he goes for [O’Reilly books](https://www.oreilly.com/), and [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/). He’s less knowledgeable about front end stuff. [Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary-dp-0135957052/dp/0135957052/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) that he needs to finish, now that he’s team leading.
*   [Podcast listening](https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/wiki/podcasts). Core devs of libraries they use. Movement from consulting. He’d click on stuff he liked and was interested in. Podcasts are closer to the ground than TED, which is very curated.
