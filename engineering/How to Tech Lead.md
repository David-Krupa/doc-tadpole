## BrainGu Best Practices for Starting, Organizing, and Leading Technical Teams

Congratulations! You’re the new tech lead on your project. Now what?


## Starting Out

### Joining a new project

*   Define scope and objectives
    *   What are deliverables and deadlines
*   Determine who the customer is
*   Define process and procedure
*   Identify pain points or blockers in existing processes/organization


### Taking over an existing project

*   How is the environment setup
    *   Review existing documentation
    *   Seek out tribal knowledge
*   Software requirements
*   What does the current team/customer think your team is doing
*   Figure out if there are important meetings, points of contact, system accounts that you should be added to
*   Decide what to keep and what to throw away
    *   Be careful if somebody loves what you’re throwing away/spent months working on it
*   Determine morale of the team
    *   Snacks help
        *   Punch and pie
*   Upsert documentation to be current and complete
*   Figure out what the customer thinks the roles/responsibilities of the “tech lead” are
    *   Just translating requirements into technical tasks? Collecting and defining requirements?


### Invariants

*   Who are the important people/stakeholders
*   How to [guide | interact | task] with other contractors, either primes or subs.
    *   Including performance accountability
    *   How to hold people accountable when they are the client ← have some case studies for this?
*   What are the resource constraints? Budget limitations, staffing bottlenecks, procurement timetables


## Bringing Order to Chaos

### Improving communication

*   What medium to use and when (maybe even templates for stand-ups, syncs, etc).
*   How to foster good peer-to-peer communications within your team.
*   Figure out what hours people work and when they are available
*   Set ground rules for availability and being on call
    *   This will vary based on role on the team and need for quick operational response


### Implementing process

*   Atlassian stack
*   Standardized source control procedure
    *   Link to Gil’s favorite one
    *   Code style guidelines
*   Centralized logging, including incident tracking and audit (as needed)
*   Deployment procedure
    *   Review gates, security approvals, verification steps
    *   Configuration management development, approval, deployment process
    *   Passing unit tests, certain % coverage?
*   Security review and approval
*   Establish/determine maintenance windows, if necessary
*   Identify key approvers (internal and external)
    *   Who needs to sign off on what level of change?
*   OPSEC rules for networks, projects, personnel
*   Establish documentation requirements and location


### Determine high-level architecture

*   What are you using for configuration management?
*   What kind of environments will you work in (this will inform your position requirements)?
    *   AWS? VMWare? Azure? All of the above?
    *   Legacy environments? What problems do they have that will impact your design?


## Keeping Momentum

### Finding good candidates

*   Go to conferences/training and make your work sound interesting
*   Make sure your job postings stay in sync with the work you’re doing
*   Make sure rates/budget support the candidates you need
*   Figure out what you want people to do and look for them that way, rather than just trying to fill spots
*   Make sure that recruiting process is efficient, not wasting people’s time


### Integrating new people

*   Introductory tasks
    *   Get used to process, procedures, where information lives
*   Create a written onboarding process
    *   Where resources live, what steps to go through to get set up
    *   Written baseline business day-to-day requirements and expectations
*   Onboarding “tutorial quest”
    *   Fetch quests for getting up to speed


### Improving your people

*   Regular rotations (particularly for BG people) to stop people from getting stuck on a project
    *   Potentially both inside the project and on other work
*   Encouraging training and professional development


### Expanding the scope

*   Adding another layer of management/structure/processes
    *   E.g. centralized logging, CCB, sub-teams
*   Convincing customer to add new personnel/funding
*   Gather metrics on usage, input/output, and growth


## Passing the Torch

### Transitioning a replacement

*   Make sure there is sufficient overlap for new tech lead to learn what the day-to-day is
*   Do some written knowledge transfer
    *   Including important people, what their roles are, and their attitudes toward the team, the tech lead, BG, etc.
*   Do an in-person meeting, preferably including whoever the tech lead reports to for part of that time
*   Current list of active projects, upcoming projects, past projects that might come up again
*   Any existing deadlines, milestones
*   Try to start from a steady state
    *   Fill any open positions, wrap up projects nearing completion
*   Make it easy for them to do all the things in the ”Taking over an existing project” section
