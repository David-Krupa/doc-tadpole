## Client relations

### How is “Team” different from “Team of Teams”?

Matt’s definitely closer to the McChrystal model, and very similar from teams to t-o-t. It changes from having those senior engineers becoming team leads, making sure they have the context and empowerment to make their own decisions, and then where that comes into play is setting the priorities and process for those leads to follow. Then advising them on personnel issues and personality differences and how to get an efficient team working together and working through that. One thing he does, goes with BrainGu culture, is setting up 1:1s for his team, and then having those not just work on career growth and feedback, but having them bring questions with their own teams for feedback. What decisions did they make? Why did they make them? And then get feedback from that.

### Learn by (Bad) Example

He got a lot of his insight watching his past managers through large companies either command the entire direction without input, or only being asked for input during disaster and not for strategy or process. That’s the thing with empowerment that he found with his career — not just telling someone they have authority, it’s walking them through, and reaching out to them to make the decision, rather than waiting for them to. A lot of his past career never had any managers that were doing that, so instead it was him working behind the scenes in the spirit of their wishes to accomplish the task.

*   **Amway** — Manager wanted him to have him work with Business Development, gathering requirements for updating the intranet to have the latest docs. So he was like, “gather all their stuff, set expectations it’ll be done in 2-3 months, and bring me what they want and we’ll put it on the list.” Which was ridiculous, because these types of changes are super small. That type of thing that needed to be done was like, 30 minutes of work, and so what ended up happening, he did the edits with them in the room, rather than gather requirements.
*   **KPMG** — when he was leading a team but wasn’t allowed to give any of his team members elevated privileges to make edits. They had to come to him, and he was a focal point for what goes in and out. So he set up a review session, and shared his credentials so they could do it themselves, because it was a policy decision, but not an engineering decision. That allowed his team to deliver faster, because every other team had to wait for one person to do anything.



### Agile

Agile scrum master for building out requirements, client expectations, setting technical delivery dates, demos, etc

*   The core of frameworks is about delivering the solution or implementation quickly to get feedback, not waiting for 100% or even 50% done. That’s why agile works for him. So for leadership, it’s building a culture of having your eng come to you with dumb questions and for that to be ok. For a team lead, building client relationships where we come to you with what seems unfinished work, but that allows for minor course-corrections. That comes from bad experiences showing stuff mostly done. The spirit of that is, you don't want to look like you’re ot an expert or providing the best value. In reality, it’s the opposite, because you’re avoiding user-centered feedback.
*   Try to figure out if we were understanding the problem incorrectly, or… is the client wrong? (that’s also valid). Because clients know what they want, in the sense that they’ve thought through the problem more than we have, but they don;t know all the diff tech approaches to handling it. What they may have in thor head may not be the best way of doing things any more. Then it’s just talking through why you made the decisions you made. Whether it’s misunderstanding the issue, or if you’re advising it be done differently, or why.


### Business Development

Sales/Business development with clients based on trust, providing initial discovery/architecture pro bono that then results in consulting agreements.

*   The ability to see this and act on it is the difference between Senior and Principal Engineers. Build a very bare-bones prototype that says “this is our potential in a day — imagine what we could do in a month?”
*   We do this anyway, because it makes the new person an advocate. If you look at an advocate, you lose trust when you’re “referred by a friend”. We get around that by doing this for every initiative we can, so that each lead is doing word of mouth.
    *   There’s a diminishing amount of trust as you bolt on a friend of a friend of a friend. With all referrals, if you don’t build a unique connection, when you go back for more work, they have to know you, not be the guy who did that one thing one time. It’s getting buy-in for BrainGu at every contract level.
    *   That goes on him and the Principals. The amount of pro bono work changes depending on the size of the contract. If it’s massive, like WIDOW, we understood the problem for a long time but there were a lot of political moves made, where we were going to be advising, not actually building the product, because that company got two years of funding $3mil. They’d built a product but didn’t solve the need. The government hates (esp in software) duplicating effort when it’s blatant. So they were put in an advising position. We tried. They didn’t want us to do that. So they did the normal consulting thing of not doing much, delaying, etc. So he made the decision for WIDOW, essentially “screw these guys, we’ll build it ourselves in a month.” Then when it was time for sync, we said, “here it is, it already works, we did it in a month. That changed the delta for them to lose funding and us to gain.
    *   We also did Puma. That was for a big O&G company. Similar type of gamble. They got burned by three consultants over two years. We were like, “hey, we can do it and it’s not that hard. We can customize Sharepoint.” and they were like “we’ve heard this before”. And Matt pitched the idea “how about we deliver this in a month, and if we don’t meet the deadline, you pay us nothing, and you keep everything. And if we do, you pay us $250K.” We estimated $90K over three months, or $500K in two weeks. Or $1.2 mill in one week. They picked the $250K option.  We managed in a month, no issues. If you’re going to bet, bet on yourself.
    *   Impact on team morale? There was definitely an increase in “yeah, we did it!” It was good. I don't know if it was from the team saying “thank you for choosing me” because they already know we trust them with what we’re doing. There was definitely a “yeah we did it”.


### Growing Teams

Each program Matt’s led at BrainGu, he’s increased initial staff 2x-5x.

*   What drives that increase? He thinks that’s where the sales comes in to leading a project. If you’re leading a project with your team delivering excellent results, then nothing’s going to change. But if you’re doing that and while you’re delivering what the client wants and look at other areas they need help in and follow up and push saying “hey we can solve this problem with these people,” if you’re already a trusted source, then that’s a pretty easy sell. But you have to be looking for those opportunities. First gain trust, then look for opportunity, then make recommendations. If you don’t do that, you just stay fixed in that contract with that client.
*   How does he coach his leads with this? During 1:1s, but especially talking to the team, “are you asking them what problems they’re running into? What problems do we see?” If the answer is “we don’t have the people” then propose more people. We’re not honestly doing a great job of coaching this right now. It’s a hard process for engineers, to go into making that recommendation. You’re not trying to sell a crappy car, you’re trying to solve their problem. You making a suggestion and bringing in BrainGu is solving their problem.
*   There’s definitely a disconnect there and we’re learning our lesson of trying to evolve folks who just want to be employees. Instead we need to support employees looking for that next step. It’s 100% a personality process.

### Managing different levels of engineer

When managing juniors, daily updates are not enough. Every single junior gets into this research-digging hole, where they don’t have a lot of work, they get lost, and they don’t reach out for help. No matter how often you tell them to reach out, 99% of them won’t. As a lead, you need to recognize the time segments to check in with them, enforce that connection. The more that's normalized, the more they’ll  reach out to you. If you’re being mentoring and not condescending, they’re more apt to come to you.

The squad and team leads are responsible for maintaining behavior. For his squad, he gives all crx and stuff to the whole team, but the team leads follow up with interaction more day to day. Team leads and tech leads have a delegation of responsibility, but willingness to pivot. One of the big things there, when you’re tech leading, you need to be guiding and not countermanding. If a team lead makes an incorrect decision, rather than publicly correcting that, take them aside, make the correction, and then make the change together. It’s an inside the shell thing. Delegation doesn’t help if everyone still goes to the tech lead. When you undermine the team lead, you’re saying “don’t trust them, trust me”. It’s a different form of inside the shell, where it’s giving the team leads the tools to build the trust within their team.
