## Concepts

*   Most DevSecOps workload is [declarative-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) configuration.
*   Most hands-on-keyboard work is interacting with [YAML](https://yaml.org/) and [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).
    *   [https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2759572](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2759572)
*   Lots of templating.
    *   [Jinja2](https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/)
    *   [Golang](https://golang.org/)

Know how to write a script, or end up doing things that make you sad. It’s a product of the (consulting) environment; you have to work with what you’re given. You have to bring tools with you, and sometimes executing the tools is difficult. You end up resorting to bash, because you always have a shell.
*   Learn your languages
    *   Sam prefers the upstream docs.
    *   Look for examples in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
    *   Never blindly copy paste.
