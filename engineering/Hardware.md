## Tools: Hardware


## Selection

It’s beneficial to be able to use what’s available, whether that’s personal, Enterprise, or networking gear. When selecting hardware for yourself or clients, as long as the components are a little future-proof, that’s what matters. No preference on make/model/etc.

It’s nice to have high quality tools when visiting a client site. When working in a SCIF, it’s also important to be able to have everything you need right in the unit, so be sure to consider that possibility.
