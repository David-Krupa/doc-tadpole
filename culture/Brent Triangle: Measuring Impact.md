## The Brent Triangle: Measuring Impact

The final step in [Change the Box](5996549.html) is "Make an Impact". We use the **_Brent Triangle_** to evaluate the _impact level_ of a potential action. This is a simple gut check which helps us determine where to focus our energy, and which things to avoid.

Additionally, the Brent Triangle is used to qualify leads to determine what opportunities to pursue, and provides us with a framework to re-evaluate how a project’s impact has evolved over time.

## Criteria

Each of the following three criteria are ranked on a scale from 0-3.

*   **0** = negative or zero impact

*   **1** \= below average impact

*   **2** = average impact

*   **3** \= above average impact


**Mission:** The impact a given action would have on the success of a customer’s mission and/or BrainGu’s mission.

**Engagement:** The impact on personal and/or team success the expected outcome of a given action would bring.

**Financial:** The expected positive financial impact of an action in comparison to the level of resources expended.


### Breaking Down: Mission

> _"The impact a given action would have on the success of a customer’s mission and/or BrainGu’s mission."_

**Examples:** Accomplishing a goal within a difficult time window which other teams could not do, creating a mission supporting capability that did not previously exist, clear and present improvement to life and death circumstances.

Measuring _Mission_ impact is a two-tiered process that requires the following: 1) measuring _how_ the opportunity is impactful, and 2) _who_ is impacted.

*   **How**: For a mission to be truly (positively) impactful, it needs
    *   **_To be successful:_** the work needs to end up positively affecting the lives of customers outside the immediate delivery team.
    *   **_To be smart:_** The engagement is structured in a way that allows us to come in and do what we do best without having one hand tied behind our back.

*   **Who**: Where a mission’s impact is being felt in at least one of the following (these may not always be the same)
    *   The Customer’s mission
    *   The BrainGu mission
    *   The larger Industry/Community

### Breaking Down: Engagement


> _"The impact on personal and/or team success the expected outcome of a given action would bring."_

**Example:** Challenging or interesting work that will be personally fulfilling, working with a new technology that the whole team is excited to get their hands on, getting a chance to prove some theory by being the most awesome.

Measuring _Engagement_ includes consideration of the following elements:

**_Sith Model_**

It provides BrainGu employees with a support system (minimum of two people where at least one individual is senior to BrainGu culture in addition to skill/experience in order to provide mentorship/guidance to other team members).

**_Technology_**

It provides BrainGu technologists and engineers with the opportunity to use/learn cutting-edge technologies, or improve technical skills on particular technologies individuals have proficiency in.
*   This takes into account the skillsets required for a project and how that matches the roles on a project.

**_Good Customer_**

The relationship with the customer has to motivate BrainGu folks to want to work with this person/team.

  *   This takes into consideration how well their requirements match BrainGu’s flexibility ethos to include: core work hours, location, and qualification requirements (e.g., clearances)





### Breaking Down: Financial

> _"The expected positive financial impact of an action in comparison to the level of resources expended."_

**Example:** An opportunity adds significant revenue and profit margin to the company based on rates against expended costs on the project, opportunity to grow the engagement, and the duration of said project.

_Financial Impact_ takes into consideration the following:

**_Profit Margin_**

This is based on the duration of the engagement. Lower margins are acceptable if the duration of the engagement is high (shorter duration engagements justify a higher margin).

**_Number of Employees_**

Flexibility is a plus here. BrainGu measures profit per person, not profit per project—allowing us to prioritize people instead of projects.

**_Skill-level Required_**

Ideally, the project requires a mix of capabilities and skill levels.

### Final Score

Wherever possible, we seek to maximize impact. To determine the potential _impact level_ of an action, we add the three criteria scores together.

*   **< 3: Below Average Impact**
*   **3-5: Average Impact**
*   **\> 5: Above Average Impact**

## Credits

This scoring system was devised by Brent Johnson in explaining how we choose the best path. Thus, it is called the "Brent Triangle". ("That triangle idea that Brent mentioned for measuring the goodness of things" was too long to say.) Please see [The Brent Triangle](https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/wiki/Brent-Triangle) for more detailed explanation of how and why this Triangle was created, and is used.
