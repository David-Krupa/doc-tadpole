## Overview

**Change the Box** is our official company mantra. It's the essence of everything that runs through our operations, our thought process, and (hopefully) our results. This page breaks down variations and fleshes out of the concept.

## TL;DR

**1) As a top-level idea:**  To make things better, one step at a time, and have an impact.

**2) In a simple process:**  Measure > Model > Modify

**3) Informally and succinctly:**  _suck less_

## Change the Box

Change the Box is more of a vision level concept that we use in business documentation. Traditionally, the saying is "think outside the box." Because of this, all too often, when approaching the "impossible," people assume a current or previously-tried approach is completely useless. However, we believe that all progress against a difficult outcome is valuable, so we seek to evaluate the situation, maximize its strengths, and minimize its weaknesses. We don't want to abandon the box; we want to change it for the better &mdash; leveraging its strengths to give us a head start on solving the problem.

When asked to lay out what it means to Change the Box, we break it down to three pieces:

**Do It Better*
-   We want to always be better and deliver better
-   Change is necessary to keep improving (nothing is perfect)

**One Step at a Time**
-   Scratch the itch &mdash; Best impact with the smallest change
-   Stay in Motion &mdash; Keep stepping forward, scratching the next itch
-   Lather, rinse, repeat

**Make an Impact**
-   Achieve what others consider impossible
-   Evolve the state of the art
-   Reduce the problem set by an order of magnitude

## Measure > Model > Modify

**Measure > Model > Modify** is the quick process for changing the box.
- First, _Measure_  the situation by evaluating existing assets against the challenge at hand.
- Second, _Model_  a plan to apply those assets in a way that will most quickly begin to make a difference.
- Then, _Modify_  the situation by running your plan and getting that change into the hands of real users. Once you have real world usage, go back to the _Measure_  step to see how effectively you hit the mark, _Model_  your next step in solving the problem, and _Modify_  again until the problem is solved.

-   **Measure:** Recognizing Reality
No one develops solutions in a vacuum. The reason to build is to service an organizationally driven goal. Both the political and technical environments where solutions will be deployed must be taken into account. Understanding customer pain points and constraints inform design.

-   **Model:** Architecture in Motion
The underlying infrastructure of a robust system should be just as flexible as the application itself. With a well-architected foundation in place, new networks and services can be brought to life using programmatic deployment and configuration management methods. Closing the gap between development and operations means consistently delivering capability.


-   **Modify:** Agile Development
Taking an Agile approach means that we don’t design a behemoth and build it in milestones. Our focus is to seek a minimum viable product (MVP) and ship it while it can still be useful. From there, we interact frequently with customers to iteratively develop improvements to a system, delivering new functionality as often as possible.

## Suck Less

It's the informal motto of BrainGu and it unpacks in several layers. Our ethos leads us to seek improvement every day and remain humble regardless our of progress. Since nothing is perfect and everything starts from an inferior state, we recognize the opportunity to make an improvement. The  [slang definition](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/suck#Verb)  of the word "suck" means  _"to be inferior or objectionable"_ . As a counterpoint to "make things better," "suck less" has a sharper edge on it which keeps reminding us that we're not perfect and there's more work to be done. Plus, it's short and to the point!

## The Process in Detail

1.  **Get your Bearings**
    -  Understand the problem at hand
    -  Figure out who, what, and how has already been tried
2.  **Make a Plan**
    -  Diving blindly into the abyss might be exciting, but could also be disastrous
    -  Make a plan that covers your next iteration in detail, and give a sense of what happens after that
3.  **Start with an MVP**
    -  Rome wasn't built in a day
    -  Take it one bite at a time
    -  Always work in the direction of a solution
4.  **Iterate & Refine**
    -  Get better every day
    -  Stay humble
    -  Keep improving while remaining objective
5.  **Keep Moving**
    -  Pipeline forward momentum across multiple workstreams
    -  Directionality is key; even small movements are progress
6.  **Step with Confidence**
    -  Worrying is a waste of time and energy; focus on building
    -  Step back, collect your composure, and then do it like you knew you could
7.  **Lean on the Team**
    -  No one is an island; we are stronger as a team
    -  If you're stuck, someone here can help you
    -  If you see someone stuck, lend them a hand
8.  **Recognize your Contribution**
    -  Stop and smell the roses
    -  Take nothing for granted
    -  Take a break, assess your work, move again with purpose.
9.  **GO TO 1**


## Change the Box: Matt's Tips

*   One of the biggest things, and the importance of Change the Box, is knowing what _the box_ is. If you change the status quo from the past to now, the box is changed. So for any new project, depending on what the industry set is, you’re not changing the box if the industry has already caught up. Where the industry hasn’t caught up is really leveraging this distributed workforce in the defense realm, where you have engineers with clearances that can understand the problem, and build the problem, and break the problem set down for the other engineers.
*   To zoom out, how would the typical industry handle a project like WIDOW today? They’d have a month-long requirement-gathering process to build sprints and their sprint plans, the engineers would spend the next month on designs and implementations, and the sprints would be based around delivery on those designs. The typical thing for the industry is Agile-fall (waterfall, but in sprints) until it’s ready to develop, and _then_ you get into a more typical Agile cycle. Where BrainGu is different is that we spend a large percentage of the time outside the project understanding the problem set. Then we use that knowledge to do designs the first week, and developing and iterating the second week. Current industry cycle is at month timespans, and BrainGu is at weeks. This is also being solved in a lot of other small businesses, because they have that flexibility. So we’re not unique, we’re just very good at it. But small business is the minority in this type of work.
*   Some clients balk at the inside/outside model, because a lot of people think you need to understand the full picture of a problem set. The applications aren't classified; what’s classified is the data it talks about. So say you’re planning an Air Force mission, and you’re trying to plan a carrier sending a number of ships and a base is sending other ships, and they’re going to intersect and then travel together. The exact time, location, position could be classified, but to a developer that doesn’t matter. For an engineer that’s just a string, a float, an integer. The majority of the contracts are written for onsite cleared engineers. It’s an inertia thing, of software at its core, that didn’t have a good abstraction from different environments and data. Then the software improved to handle a disconnect between programs and data, but the policies haven’t changed. This is something that BrainGu changed the box in. Other businesses are throwing up their hands and saying “this is a dumb policy and you shouldn’t do it and we’re not going to bid on work that says “on site.””  BrainGu philosophy is, “yeah, policy needs work, but we’ll put some people onsite and some off,” and then we change their minds from the inside. So at the next action, they need a team of two instead of six onsite.

## Examples of Changing the Box

### Distributed Workforce

Less rare in the commercial sector, but exceedingly so in defense contracting. We tweaked a key variable and have been able to leverage off-site staffing to keep quality high while keeping costs reasonable for our customers.

-   Why
    -   To maximize focus time in a controlled environment so tech people can do their best work
    -   To keep staffing costs reasonable while providing senior, experienced talent
    -   To reduce the amount of office space/equipment needed to perform the job
    -   To minimize time lost to commutes
    -   To find the best staff available, regardless of geography
    -   To provide increased comfort and convenience to our staff
-   How
    -   Hybridize: Pair a cleared, local core workforce with a highly competent remote workforce.
    -   Tool up: Leverage tools and infrastructure to provide the same capabilities to local and remote staff.
    -   Consistent Communications: Local staff work remote a few days a week as well, promoting adoption and usage of remote communications in and out of the office.
    -   Change the taskings: Most classified work is a result of the data, not the tooling. So we leverage our remote staff to build the tools in an unclassified setting with unclassified data, while our local staff can be on-site to provide integration of classified data and project oversight with full knowledge of the working pieces.
-   Multi-disciplinary staff
    -   Why
        -   To tackle integrated challenges where a problem is only solved by cooperation between multiple fields.
        -   Most of the "impossible" things are caused by gaps in the traditional divisions of labor which prevent successful integration.
        -   A single perspective is often not nuanced enough to find solutions to difficult problems.
        -   "If you only have a hammer, every problem becomes a nail."
    -   How:
        -   "That's not my job" does not get uttered in our team. If it's a problem, it's my job to either solve it or work with my team to do so.
        -   Everyone we hire has experience in a "major" and a "minor" and we work to ensure these overlap in a complimentary fashion across the team.
        -   We use Python as a common language to share ideas between disciplines, but seek to share tools whenever feasible.

### Building WIDOW: Changing the Box

  *   Get your bearings
        *   [**Understanding the problem at hand**](https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/wiki/handbook-for-the-impossible#breaking-down-change-the-box) — We had multiple 1:1 meetings with Ralphie about how Air Force mission planning is conducted today, and in the past.
        *   [**Figure out who**](https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/wiki/handbook-for-the-impossible#the-process-in-detail) — We had meetings with five other companies that had already built distribution solutions for planning. Some focused on map, some on collaboration, some on AF/NV/AR integration. But none focused on delivering something that could be used immediately.
        *   **Make a plan** — WIDOW, from a tech perspective, is a React frontend with a Django backend. We get a lot of questions about “why not arch with javascript/node, why are you using React when you could use Django templates, why is REST API set up?” There are tons of “better ways” to build an enterprise solution, if you have ~2000 users using it every day at the same time. We’re good at React and good at Python, so why not just use that? Stick with what you know.
        *   **MVP** — We were building the minimum viable product (MVP) because we knew the data model and the design. As the design came back and was changed, we embraced that change into #4, iterate and refine. We weren’t changing the whole solution, but page by page multiple times, and that kept us moving forward to accomplish
        *   **Keep moving** — Validate the design, build the frontend and backend, and do this in a fashion that can receive a CTF (cert to field), meaning that it’s legally usable, not just a demo.
        *   **Step with confidence** — We didn't worry about a map or about being fancy. We recognized that the problem at hand was that the majority of time was being lost in administration, and the more hours we cut off that time, the more they could spend on tactics. We didn’t try to be fancy; we kept moving forward not worrying about “best of the best,” just good quality, stable, and usable.
        *   **Lean on the team** — You need to have a constant stream of communication between peers, and have the trust to know they have your back, so that if you’re stuck they can help.
        *   **Recognize contributions** — That’s on delivery. You just built something not in three years but in one month, and you’ve already made a difference for the Air Force. We built WIDOW in four weeks.

WIDOW’s on version 4 now. Same steps over and over.

### Measure > Model > Modify

*   We embed the people with the clearances in the room with the mission planning team.
*   Do a usability study, not like “we’re leading it” but in an observational state. They’re doing their mission. We are distractions. This is where “measure” really comes in. We’re measuring specifically.
*   A lot of them had a coordination card ready. They’d bring the app to one side of the screen and the card to the other. They didn’t think they needed to make it responsive. So recognizing this, meant it needed to be half-page responsive.
*   So what’s the model for that? Build it in a half-responsive way, not all the way to phone, but to half screen. If they have a ton of assets to manage, the page looks great with pictures, but they’re trying to get the job done, and don’t need the pics. They need a condensed view of their assets. With that, then comes...


#### Modify
*  We took the models, piped them back to the team, the team modified them, and then we were able to, in the room, have the users refresh the screen and have a condensed view. So over 30 minutes, they have a view rather than a scroll.
*  Day after day, we modified after observations. If they thought they could type but it was a dropdown, we changed the style.
*   Recognizing user frustration without them having to speak about it is changing the box.
*   You could do this not just at high stakes, but elsewhere, depending on prioritization. If you have a main set of engineers standing by, and some onsite, there’s no difference. Is your DevSecOps process robust enough to handle that without fear of crashing the system? We did 350 updates over three weeks. We had zero downtime.
*   We got a ton of buy-in from the operators in the Air Force who have nothing to do with software; they’re pilots, comms, nuclear silo people. Zero concept of software. But they know that they need — with software, everyone worries about the non-happy path. When you’re in a mission environment, they’re not trying to do something stupid, they’re doing it fast and correctly, so the most efficient happy path. Without a doubt, WIDOW was very vulnerable to being broken in the very beginning. But this is about “suck less.” We knew we weren’t going to have users trying to do an integer overflow on the quantity of airplanes. We knew they weren't doing DDoS on WIDOW. Also the user scale was predictable. The industry doesn't have a grasp on this; “sucking less” in the way that you’re the most successful and improve from that point when you need to.
*   Feather-soothing? Yes and no. No frustrated people, but a thing that happens with any successful software is the idea of “what else can this do?” “Why doesn't it have this?” Most of those, we logged, which was good for the relationship part because their voices are heard, but also we iterated “what you’re using was built in 4 weeks.” This gives them brand new appreciation. For pilots, typical software turnaround for critical fixes is seven years.
      *   Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon… all those main DoD contractors that make billions a year set up specific contracts on capabilities. When new issues are found, new contracts are spun up. That takes 3-6 months. Debug, reproduce, validate… find the issue, fix the issue, then since it’s not a continuous ATO, and the ATO process can take years, because the whole system has to be vetted every time for every change. And they’re billing every hour for that. Those billions of $ for jets aren’t going to jets, they’re going to the consulting companies.
      *   The fastest fix he’s seen took three years.
      *    When you look at why so many organizations have the potential to make a massive difference in the DoD but are unwilling to play by their rules, that's_ where Change the Box comes in. The DoD is the largest corporation in the world, and it’s not going to move quickly. It’s going to move on the scale of ~10-20 years at a time. And every small difference — every time we get included and get more buy-in and show more proof, the DoD changes for the better. That’s what “mission focused” means.
