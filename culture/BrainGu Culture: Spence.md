## BrainGu Culture: Spence

These documents separate things into buckets, but Spence thinks of them holistically. He’s into entropy.

*   What’s the lowest energy state that makes these things congruent or cohesive?
*   When we add a new whatever, how does he add these things up for smallest change, largest impact?
*   People who care and are curious, belong here. If you care, you bring yourself to your work fully and you want those impacts to be positive.
*   BrainGu’s low energy state is high energy compared to other places.
*   Unspoken thing about BrainGu culture is that it’s a hive thing, where we’ve woven connectivity with connected ideas. Most places are super linear. When we build a process (expense reporting) we don’t just do it from finance, we do it from a “what will be convenient for people to keep up with? What kinds of spending will incentivize behavior we want to encourage?” If you have to work around our system to buy someone a coffee, that’s not optimal.
*   Tesseract or hypercube. Crystalline state which is low energy, but takes energy to get there.


## Technical Culture

*   BrainGu is really isolated from the industry cultures. Each of us has our relationships to people who work in the industry through conferences or acquaintances, forums, etc. But not many BrainGu people identify as “members of the hacking cliques.” That may just be the personality of people who belong here. Could just be people are too busy to put up with the drama.
*   He doesn’t like most hacker culture — he thinks the hype gets in the way of getting things done. It’s science, not magic. Innovation does involve creativity, but at the end of the day, hacking with computers is a very rigorous and logical undertaking. If you can’t teach others because you’re too special, that’s not OK, especially for an industry that prides itself on being a meritocracy. It’s an industry that loves to help people get in, but they will hide tricks they use because they want to make it more special.
*   The shared lie and doubletalk of any industry. No doubletalk is a value. Do what you say you will do, not a through a prism version of that thing.
*   “I love working with BrainGu because I always learn so much. They’re not hiding their secret sauce — no weird boundaries. Having them around makes them better practitioners.”


## Leadership Culture

*   “I started a company for nerds”
*   Businesses run by business people try to reduce engineering outputs to what they understand in a spreadsheet. But you shouldn’t limit the expression of the business overal to that which can be in a spreadsheet.
*   Managers who are not technical want to constrain the employees to that which they can understand. Takes a lot of humility for a leader to expect and understand that things are happening that they don't get, and that’s fine, as long as the things taking place make the goals of the customer and the business.
*   An engineer that has to spend all day convincing their PM, when the PM doesn't have the tech background to understand… It can be insulting to prove yourself over and over to people who are willfully ignorant of the basics of your job functioning. No matter how humble or self aware, it erodes morale, and your willingness to push forward and innovate. (Maslow). Making change and innovating is a hard thing.
*   If he had someone getting between him and good ideas, he wouldn’t like his job very much. And he’s had that — goes back to the self-selecting.
*   A person isn’t just what they can do for you that makes money. When he talks about work life integration rather than balance. Work isn’t the opposite of life; if it is for you, you’re in the wrong field. Work isn’t always fun, but on the whole, his life and work are well-integrated and he’s happy with it. He wants that for everyone that’s here. Shouldn’t just be the privilege of the person at the top of the pyramid.  \



## [Inside the Shell](https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/wiki/the-shell%3A-making-room-for-ideas)

*   “How do we do it” was the predecessor doc.
*   Many of these do come from hard fought/hard won real world scenarios that we wanted to capture.
*   The most common thing he sees people struggle with is sharing their work before it’s polished. People are so trained and tuned to not bring anything until it’s “ready” — nothing is ever *ready*. In keeping with the concept of “minimal viable product,” recognizing that the job is never done. Getting people to work in smaller chunks and being more collaborative is super important. It’s been important to BrainGu’s success. If you look at a person’s work product at the end of a day and you can course correct early on, you get a different (closer) endpoint.
*   Within BrainGu, he wants every manager at every level to be fostering open, collaborative, innovative processes. Small chunks and iterate rapidly. “Failing fast”.
*   There is a very narrow plane of existence for highly technical people to deal with the ambiguity of business between what’s said and what appears to be true.
*   Duty is to everyone at BrainGu. If someone is a risk to the overall culture, then letting them stay in is him not doing his job.
*   People either trust him, or they do not. It’s his goal that he does the things that build the rapport necessary to build the reservoir of trust that people believe the execs. I mean to be what you see, I don’t mean to be other than that. As CEO, his personal feelings are less relevant than outcomes. As the CEO, the veracity or perceived veracity matters.
*   Transparency. In a group of this size where people aren’t homogenous, the sense of trust was 100% earlier. Now, it’s not that close. But it can be insulting, when he communicates something and it comes back at him, misperceived. It’s hard to disassociate from the heat you receive. You have to have patience and not be offended.
*   He opened the door to that.. He opened Pandora's box. What surprises him is the sense of injustice that people come to the table with. Listening openly deflates the anger. Maybe they recognize they didn't need to get that heated, and they don’t have the EQ, so they find something else. The reality of it is, anyone at BrainGu can communicate with him. They’re not adverse to constructive criticism. What he hears is a lack of ownership. He hasn’t heard of a company as able to change as here.
*   People don’t know what to do when their voice actually matters. As we think things through more deeply, what are the ways in which we can coach people into more constructive forms of feedback and true participation in the culture? It’s better if you participate in making the change you want.
*   He works with a business coach. Not overfocusing on a single event, and trying to extrapolate/project against other things happening. Sometimes it just doesn't work out, but the real shame is to stop taking chances. He’s most anxious about communicating with the staff.  \



## Questions and Answers

### Q: “Achieving the impossible” — what precisely do you mean by “impossible”?

*   He’s heard from so many practitioners that something is “impossible” because policy doesn’t allow or staff doesn't have skills or deptthe department doesn’t have budget or… but they don’t make those limits explicit, and they allow those limits to constrain them. To him, the concept of “impossible” exists — he’s just never found it. Given the right resources (human, $, equip, time) all things are possible. Whether or not it’s reasonable is a different conversation. If it’s truly impossible we have to abandon the effort.
*   And also to push at the concept of “maybe we can’t do the whole thing, but what pieces of the big thing are possible?” if we can do one set of pieces, then maybe eventually we find out it wasn’t so impossible after all. You feel pretty emboldened once you have the first bit of success accomplished.  \

## [What will we do next? (Goals)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aZp7JgJX_qkPKMOjK3BbPcJahWbwX1A6b0s0w6Mabr0/edit?ts=5f3ab217#)

*   Focus has been to adopt industry tools that help you with both, from a tools and process standpoint. Rippling. Greenhouse. Lattice (employee engagement, 1:1s, team surveys), Expensify. Tools is the area they’re spending the most focus in, because that’s where they’re the most weak. This gives the Ops team space to do thought work and strategic planning. How do we do more growth better? What’s failing, onboarding, onboarding between projects, recruiting — all the things that will break at a certain scale.
*   “Much faster than anticipated” — what’s your process around anticipation? How are you looking into the future?
    *   Great sense of five months and five years,  otherwise he’s blind to it. Trying to do a more sane, data-driven extrapolation. You have to muscle through and not let the uncertainty shake you from the end state you’re trying to get to. The best plans, it’s sometimes hard to recognize they’re working.

*   Retrofuturist return to historical artisanry — Ian
    *   LOVE this. What are the primary drivers here in your thinking?
    *   2019 off the cliff. TL;dr: did not have a well-balanced book of business. When a major client fell out from one line of business, that line could no longer be supported, and everything crumbled under the weight of that loss. Forced them into only having one line of business. Commercial, and Federal. When you lose a bunch of business and have staff focused on that thing, it’s hard to rebalance. They had opportunity but couldn’t retool.
They did what they could to retrain, but can’t do that overnight. That long 2019 rebalance and transition — they have a central focus now.


## [Change the Box](https://braingu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BG/pages/5996549/Change+the+Box+A+Handbook+for+the+Impossible)

### Q: “All progress against a difficult outcome is valuable”  How does this tie in to client satisfaction, business goals, and employee skills development?

*   When he thinks of this, he thinks in relative terms. A little chunk of impossible is large. A lot of people really focus on trying to get from 0-10m but 0-1 is the hardest, and everything else is simpler.
*   If you’re hired to do a 10, the 10 is always moving. What was known five years ago about javascript is not the same now. The 10 always moves.
*   He’s looking at it from a perspective of what is known of the industry
*   If you look at most BG folks, they just magically know some of the most advanced stuff in the industry. The people dictate the technology, not the projects.
*   Ahead of the Python thing because the 2-3 migration was organic to them.


### Q: How do you assess what will “scratch the itch” for the client?

*   It just happens. They’re hired to solve problems, not to use specific tech to do a thing.
*   Sometimes the problem does dictate the tech stack, but that’s a rare thing. Generally, as a part of Change the Box, best impact for smallest change, if code exists, we’ll go there and work on that.
*   Meet the code where it is. It may be ugly or dumb or not how they’d do it, but if it’s been through production, then new code wouldn’t be beta tested and that send the client backwards.
*   It’s really figuring out scratching the itch as a team process.



### Q: What are some examples of Changing the box

*   Distributed workforce is the example. Challenged the assumption that we all need to be in the same building to get work done. We proved that remote work does work. They’re an early example with regards to the DoD.
*   We often have to have boundary setting discussions with clients. Onsite spends 60% of time in meetings, and offsite is 20%. Offsite people are generating code, and they don't have a commute so they’re happier. One thing that’s great about code is that if you’re checking in code every day we have proof of work. Digital record of productivity.
*   We’ve had situations where the rigor of a schedule, and less distractions, were important for an individual. They’ve established ~3 months of good work habits.
*   I think people get used to rigorous supervision and get used to it rather than self-starting. Break people of that habit, and train them to self-start.
*   BrainGu culture revolts against the kinds of workplaces we’ve all seen. Less positive reinforcement. Awards were essentially a popularity contest.
*   Doesn’t want to be the party line — doesn’t want to only talk about positive news. He shouldn’t have let SitRep be “relentlessly positive.”
*   Why is anyone at BrainGu? People could make more money at other companies, so what motivates them to stay here? He thinks the difference would be that there is a chance and reality here that we accept and encourage a more through and through quality approach. A lot of employers don’t like that.
*   If the customer is OK with 30%, are we *happy* about 70%? What corners are OK to cut? Everywhere else it’s always, “make the buck.”
*   All about intrinsic motivation. If you don’t find value in delivering that sort of thing you won’t find value at BrainGu. You’d take twice the salary elsewhere.
*   Picking on Google — if you’re an engineer there, you’re a cog. Your individual contributions are rarely the thing that makes the difference to the whole company. But here, everyone’s contributions truly matter. The staff here truly values their contributions to the end state. They have a lot of trouble articulating value when they shift from IC to mgmt.
    *   Google’s idea of a generalist is not the same as ours. Their process is rigorous in an academic sense. BrainGu is more practical, get shit done, hands on.
    *   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus#)
        *   Progress is more important than everyone feeling good.
        *   [https://www.ietf.org/how/runningcode/](https://www.ietf.org/how/runningcode/)
        *   What’s valuable is code that runs the standard or proves or advances the theory.
        *   At BrainGu we’d like that code to be high-quality, maintainable, well thought through. But we will get something functional early and make it more robust over time.
        *   How we hire — the attitude of the generalist is relevant. But he thinks there’s also a size thing there.
        *   Where you’re from is not who you are.
*   Goes beyond humility.


### Q: Tell me about capitalism as a tool for change.

*   We haven't always been the savviest users of the tool. Cloud Native, open source. He thinks it’s important that people not buy PR. There’s a whole lie about what makes money in open source. To him, you have to follow value streams.
*   Facebook — when you follow the value stream, it’s free to you, someone’s paying, how does that work? When Google open sourced tensor flow, is it because they’re great stewards, or because they want everyone doing AI to do it their way and point business towards them? When you see these little tips the different companies have, you have to wonder, what’s happening here? They don’t just feel so passionate about open source that Amazon is going to make some adaptation. There was a value stream thing that happened there.
*   So when we start talking about open sourcing pieces of our puzzle, we have to be eyes wide open about that. How can we provide value but also have part of that value stream come back to us? Because if we don’t it’s not sustaining and we can’t deliver new value, and we’re a flash in the pan. That’s where capitalism comes in. What he sees about nonprofits, the whole sentimentality is about draining and disappearing money, with zero focus on ROI or sustainability w.r.t. money. When they have money they make investments, but they don’t have a lasting impact or grow. They do some good stuff along the way, but they could do more good stuff if they weren’t focused on money in/ money out.
*   He wants to understand creating a value stream that is a virtuous feedback loop. Really important thing to look at is that open source companies don’t make money on the thing they open sourced.
*   We have to figure out our value stream or what we do will not sustain.
If money goes away so too the value we provide to the world. For him, improving cybersecurity is the thing. The erosion of security and privacy in the last 10 years really bothers him. He’s not sure that anybody is willing to pay for it. He’s not sure that people see the value in having secure systems or in their own privacy. Less of the population is willing to put money towards it. How do we evaluate our valuestream. Bill Gates had “put a computer on every desk”. He knew most of those computers would be running windows. How do we think about that?


### Q: [Who are we?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NA90kI8jAvUIn57uH0GtiGJxzjRg50dyqXMbxlOcUFk/edit?usp=sharing)
*   “Practice regular retrospectives”
    *   The execs meet quarterly, and do a retro. It’s not formally recorded, or clear to the org what they’ve discussed or have to make changes on. His intent would be to make those more transparent and more formal.
*   This document is largely “what we do” not “who we are”. I would have expected to see things about ethics, about challenging each other, about mutual support…
    *   He sees who we are — we are our work. We are the quality of outcomes that we provide. What we do is not that work. That is an aftereffect. Reasonably confident that the other founders would see the same thing.


## Being BrainGu

*   Thought leadership in the DevSecOps space
    *   Staying relevant past the age of “everyone can do this”
        *   We need to learn the lesson that DSO was the thing BrainGu has been doing since the beginning. They just didn’t talk about it. They didn’t think anyone else cared. The lesson for him is, we need to be thought leaders on the next thing now. 2018, “Continuous AI”. Everyone talks about AI like it’s some separate, other thing. BrainGu doesn’t give it that holy on a pedestal approach — it’s just another kind of software.
        *   For as long as everyone considers it “too special” no one will adopt it. If you extrapolate it, BG can be very positive for the community in helping smooth or bridge the gap between new paradigms and the existing state of play. We see these egotistical/toxic groups that come out with elitism around being acolytes of the new religion. He doesn’t like that. He gets wanting to be on the cutting edge and special, but if you believe what you said, you’d help bring people along. He thinks BG can do that.
    *   As a team-fueled practice
        *   Like the interaction around quantum. People who are naturally interested go and learn about it and other people see that someone’s into it and there’s a natural osmosis where info is diffused through the organization.
        *   That’s where they’re at with AI. Two projects worth. With some intentional fostering, quantum will get there as well. As we grow, osmosis will be harder and we have to add more intentionality to move things around. Like the 3D and Quantum channels. AI channel.
        *   He’s always resisted being a top-down “these are our goals to learn about”. But there’s value to organizational pillars. You can wait until we get there, or learn early. Up to you in your own career development practice. That trickles to frontline managers, volunteering people to learn about things.
