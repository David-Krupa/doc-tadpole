### What is the Shell?

The shell is how we interact with the external world.

BrainGu is a tight-knit community much like a secret society. (In some circles, referred to as the "Gu-manati".) Employment at BrainGu is highly selective for people with multidisciplinary skillsets and strong problem solving skills which extend beyond traditional technical bounds. As such, we are an elite team even when we embed within other teams. The Shell is the invisible shield that envelopes all BrainGu people into a unit and separates us from the rest of the world. This line helps us know when, who, and how it's safe to communicate openly and when we need to bring the "game face".

Somewhat like the idea of an honor group, that is, a "tribe", "gang", or "squad" that defines your code of honor. No matter where you are, you need to uphold your honor among your tribe. Even when we’re deeply embedded into a customer's team and helping them out, we keep our shields up, we don’t go native, and we cover each other. This does not mean we don’t consider ourselves a part of our customers’ teams, but we understand that there is nuance/distinction lying under the surface. This is the line where people can get in trouble with situational politics that they’re not aware of. This concept will be obvious to staff with more than a year or so under their belt, but may take some time to grasp for new people. It's up to our more experienced BG employees to help guide and train folks who've more recently come on board.


### Inside the Shell (I)

*   _I_ can **speak openly, share untested ideas, and generally be open** without getting my ass kicked (though, I reserve the right to poke fun at people in a collegial way when their ideas are misguided)
*   _I_ **get my teammates' backs on duty or off duty**. If someone is having a hard time, I help them up, I give them room to deal with it, and if they aren’t self-correcting, I help them get back on track.
*   _I_ have a responsibility to **share best practices, my experiences**, and even more importantly my critical failures with the team so everyone can learn and grow.
*   _I_ must **offer mentorship to each other** in areas that I am stronger, **graciously accept guidance** in those that I am weaker. This cross all boundaries &mdash; it’s not a top-down idea, but side-to-side.

### Outside the Shell (We)

*   _We_ put on the game face. &mdash; In most scenarios, we’re an informal and somewhat goofy team. When it’s go-time, we **lock it down and get the job done** like the consummate professionals and experts we are.
*   _We_ are **certain, prepared, and confident** in the face of challenges. &mdash; Hesitation and questioning make customers nervous. If they are asking us for something tough, they are likely under significant pressure and need reassurance themselves. Become the rock and let them know they’re covered.
*   _We_ **under-promise and over-deliver**. &mdash; Everyone promises more than they can provide. Customers grow to expect you’ll give them less than they want. When you provide them with more, it builds a significant amount of trust and goodwill.
*   **_We_ are a whole team**, not a group of individuals. &mdash; Customers must understand that when they hire BrainGu, they get an entire armada of experience, not just that of one person.
*   _We_ **never bullshit.** If there's bad news, we give it straight and true, bringing our intended solution as well. When we are at the edge of certainty, we offer a best estimate, qualify it as such, and promise to follow up with better information at the earliest possibility. The default answer is: **“I don’t know, but I will get the answer.”**
