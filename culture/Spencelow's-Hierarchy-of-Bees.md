**_NOTE: This document is the integration between the original Spencelow’s, and the [Tadpole interviews](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DWKXQLJ77gm3vSvBETxnWQPU9KaTNNmrXp6Kk4zow6w/edit#heading=h.7xfn0fc303u2). Excerpts from the original text are on the left; the Tadpole material, which provides additional context for the thinking that created Spencelow’s, is on the right_.**

Spencelow's fits at the top of [Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).


### General questions

**_How are you applying Spencelow’s to people at BrainGu every day? (Implementation vs theory)_**

I’ve only used it personally sort of without vocalizing it. And I’ve used it in a few discussions to help solve a personnel problem. So I remind people, “we’re unusual compared to the usual workplace.” Spencelow is not formally applied.


**_Tell me about the HR dynamic at BrainGu. Is this a set of things recruiters actively look for? Is People Management prepared to support people through things?_**

Part is hiring, part is the state of the current project. STOR would have been more like the jungle, and in later times is more like the autobahn, because six years of polish and maturity. (Note, this is a reference to the analogies in the original Spencelow’s document.)

**_Is this idea potentially overstating the role of the employer, or just stating a potential that the employer could fulfill for individuals who are already predisposed to search for transcendence?_**

He doesn’t think an employer is obligated to fulfill any of these, truly. An employer who wants to see people who are transcending and understands the benefits, will adopt the mindset. Ideally, this is a cultural default.

**_Meeting basic needs: Have we replaced being eaten by pumas with being fired?_**

[Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goreman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26329.Emotional_Intelligence) — physiological and neurological discussion of what emotion is. In all kinds of tests, people react to someone saying their idea is bad in a meeting like they were being eaten by a lion.


**_If not, explain how your thinking process works._**

Trying to build the [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract). At different levels of abstraction, everything connects to everything else. So how does he synthesize competing thoughts in a way to make them easier to work with or understand or remember? He doesn’t remember facts specifically, but if you ask him how something works, because he has reductive “[thinking from first principles](https://jamesclear.com/first-principles)” brain, reduce to basics and build forward. Tries not to be linear, but constructs thought processes linearly into a web that interconnects. Logical chain is easy to reconstruct.

**_Below is a table with outtakes of the original language from Spencelow on the left, and clarifying questions and answers on the right._**



<table>
  <tr>
   <td>“Transcendence”
<ul>

<li>“one finds fullest realization in giving oneself to something beyond oneself — for example, in altruism or spirituality”
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
   <td><strong><em>Something beyond oneself — what do you see that being?</em></strong>
<p>
Many people’s higher idea was their religion. Or community. Or family. In modern society, many people don’t have the connection to those things that would have existed 50 years ago. Especially, this is America. There is an independence almost to revulsion about being beholden to anyone. What is it that people do that is the thing they can be a part of, everyone has an employer or a team. They stick in to the awful for the team. He doesn't expect BrainGu to be someone’s spirituality, but it can be a conduit to have a positive impact on society. And hopefully be alongside people who care about them and who they care about.
<p>
<strong><em>Tell me about what you mean when you say “transcendence.” Are there contexts implicit?</em></strong>
<p>
Self-actualization is when you are able to have that reflective understanding of yourself, and have a better control engagement, or empowerment of yourself within yourself. Transcendence is breaking down that mental/emotional/spiritual boundary between you and the rest of your world, to where you’re really connected with everything else.
<p>
It goes back to entropy. If I’m well connected and not maintaining a barrier, that should be a lower energy state. If we talk about maintaining barriers and creating the mental lattice, you are building yourself a default rubric that’s easy to execute and doesn’t get you to decision fatigue, you can make more decisions. On a day where he already has the rubric in place, he already can make a ton of decisions.

<li>He’s enough of a control freak that he thinks he can make anything happen if he just does the right things. The person on the higher end of the power relationship has a responsibility to make sure communication is open.

Internally it took longer, but then people started saying that they weren't bringing things to him because they thought the issues were beneath him or whatever, like the CEO was too busy for small complaints.

<li>We disincentivize people from innovation. Deviation from the norm is too expensive. No-failure scenario. When you tie yourself to the center of the bell curve, you’re assuming you’ll never get negatives. Don’t want to focus on neutral or down.

<li>They’ve had people not perform. We have a PiP he’s pleased with. No one has been fired for a performance issue at BrainGu. Everyone who went through did improve. It’s not a means by which to fire, it’s a way to ensure performance.

<li>Changes to work environment

<li>Partnership/mentorship

<li>No-judgment, very detailed communication about unmet expectations

<li>“Show your work” — for the low-performing. If we see where you went wrong, we can make small tweaks with huge outcomes. Get people comfy with constructive criticism. People can help lift them up.

<li>Year five, the team quit. He took it personally. Then he got over it and understood why it happened. Got him started thinking about this hierarchy. Got a lot more specific about job descriptions and “day in the life”. On the whole it’s an improvement.

<li>Both individual and corporate. Being a tech incubator means a room full of individuals advancing the state of the art. Brain Gu is squeezing brains and getting the goodness out.

There’s a correlation between a cathedral and otherworldly feeling, and there’s something to that. <a href="https://www.alaindebotton.com/religion/">De Botton’s book</a> is influential to the thinking here. “Religion” can be replaced by “company”.

<li>He’s always thought that the secret to being Gu is like being an IT diplomat; really divorcing yourself as a person from a scenario. You’re trying to negotiate a peace between a problem and the organization that has that problem. More like a hostage negotiator.

<li>This is almost like it’s own separate/more directed thinking on Maslow. If I’m a doctor, some do well in ER situations, some are GPs. As a person, you may have a similar set of skills but your environment and predisposition are relevant to your success in the workplace.

<li>Use both as HR and as tech lead, where to place people. A person with the perfect resume and the right interview, there’s a bunch of stuff you don’t talk about that’s assumed. Then they walk in and realize how generalist BG is, they can be caught off guard. “This isn’t what I signed up for!” For someone who’s expecting train tracks, we’re a disappointment.
