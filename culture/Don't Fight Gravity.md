## Don't Fight Gravity: Solution Evaluation Criteria

The purpose of these four pillars is to ensure that proposed solutions will meet the needs of our customers and the standards of BrainGu. It is not necessary for solutions to undergo formal reviews. This is here to help inform debates on solution development.

### Culture Congruence (Blue) 

**Signifies:** Stability and Confidence

**Meaning**
Blue is about... Aligning to customer culture and solving organizational goals.

Recognize the client’s internal culture norms.

Yellow is about… Engineering process to lessen the burden on solution maintainers.

Engineer out the repetitive tasks.

*   Does this solution provide “autopilot” capabilities where possible?
