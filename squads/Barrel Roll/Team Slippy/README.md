## Welcome to Team Slippy!

We are a team focused on the LevelUP customer in San Antonio. Team Slippy is the code name for our project and we fall under [Squad Barrel Roll (SBR)](https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/wiki/Barrel-Roll).

Team Slippy is a small team that relies on each other to get things done in a hurry. While we are all individuals with diverging responsibilities, we often shift our work to what's most important to accomplish for the team. Example: Preparing a briefing for the Lt. Col in charge of our program.

In a remote work environment like ours, the short appearances we have with each other are meaningful and communications and actions build trust. A team cannot work efficiently and effectively if everyone is not working together to accomplish the same mission.

Our mission is to provide the LevelUP customer with expert technical resources and commercial industry leadership experience to help modernize the Air Force's software development process.

We foster teamwork and collaboration on our team with the following expectations:

1. Team members will be available on Slack during their work hours. Members will monitor and be responsive in appropriate team channels and to DMs from team members.
2. Team members have mandatory attendance of all inter-team meetings (standups, etc) unless there is a pressing need that is cleared with your manager and the team is aware. Communicating these things in the appropriate Slack channel is considered effective communication.
3. Team members are expected to attend BrainGu internal meetings on time with their video on and participate accordingly. If you are a stakeholder in the meeting, you should pay full attention to what's going on and not be working in the background.
4. This contract is paid by billable hours, and hours must be accounted for accurately. All hours worked should be logged into Tempo by the end of the day or at the beginning of the next day. This is vital for leaders tracking hours billed and for federal auditing integrity.
5. All PTO should be recorded in the BrainGu Team gcal. Because there are no official company holidays, make sure you log national holidays as well, if you decide to take them (4th of July, labor day, etc). In addition, notify your manager so they are aware and can arrange cover for your duties in your absence. If you are sick or have child care issues, notify your manager asap so they are aware.
6. If a teammate asks you for assistance or gives you a task to complete, you are expected to communicate with them about that task in a timely manner.
7. When in doubt, communicate it. Always better to overcommunicate than undercommunicate.

The team is extremely flexible and we understand that life happens. In my mind, "family comes first" and I will always default to that priority. However, you must communicate effectively and timely in order for everyone to understand your situation.

Being the new person on the team is tough. We want you to be a part of our success, but we need to build trust with you in order for that to happen. Actions are always louder than words, and these actions will show the team that you understand the needs of the team and are here to work together.
