# Customer Support Process

To Do:

- Add a section on the recommended Mattermost setup to help with support

As part of our contract for WIDOW, we are expected to provide support for users on unclassified environments between the hours of **0800 and 1700 Eastern**.

The expected **response time is 30 minutes**, and the expected **resolution time is 1 business day**.

## What do I need to get prepped support?

1.  You need a CAC and a CAC reader in order to access IL4 Mattermost and WIDOW production
2.  You need to log in to IL4 Mattermost and join the channels listed below
3.  You need to log into WIDOW production with your CAC and request someone on the team grant you admin rights on WIDOW. See [here](https://braingu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BG/pages/1806499849/Customer+Support+Process#How-to-grant-team-members-Superuser-access) how to do this for other team members.
4.  You need to know how to grant other users admin rights when they request that (it’s the most common incoming request). Further instructions for that are listed [here](https://braingu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BG/pages/1806499849/Customer+Support+Process#Granting-Users-Admin-Rights).

## What should I be watching?

There are two main avenues of incoming support:

- IL4 Mattermost
- Email (support@widow.app) via BrainGu Slack
  - The emails coming to support@widow.app are forwarded into the **\#iig-widow-exercise** Slack channel on the BrainGu workspace.

On IL4 Mattermost, the channels to watch are:

- **WIDOW Support**: <https://chat.il4.dso.mil/widow/channels/widow-support>
- **WIDOW Town Square**: <https://chat.il4.dso.mil/widow/channels/town-square>
- If during an exercise, the **exercise specific channel**
  - e.g. Thunderbolt Flag Support: <https://chat.il4.dso.mil/widow/channels/widow-support-thunderbolt-flag>

## What do I need to do?

While monitoring the proper channels, you are expected to provide Tier 1 support and route the incoming questions/requests to the appropriate team member (if necessary) to provide Tier 2 support.

### Tier 1 Support

Tier 1 support means that you are the "front line" for the customer support process. Your responsibilities here include:

- Regularly monitoring the proper channels (listed above) to look for new incoming requests/questions/issues
- When a user messages on one of those channels, immediately respond to the customer letting them know that you have received their message and you will look into their ticket
- If their issue is something that you can handle yourself, then provide the user with an estimate of how long it will take you, resolve their issue, and then reply to them afterward to let them know if is completed
- If the issue is something that you can’t handle, then reach out to the right person(s) on the team to get the issue resolved.

**It is important throughout the process to keep the customer in the loop with updates on what’s going on and the estimated time to resolution. The customer should not feel like we have forgotten about them, even if we are working on the issue — transparency is key.**

### Tier 2 Support

Tier 2 support means that you are there to help solve issues if the person providing Tier 1 support cannot handle the incoming ticket themselves.

Your responsibility is to help the person providing Tier 1 support to solve and verify the issue, while they handle the communication to the customer.

### Granting Users Admin Rights

When a user on IL4 Mattermost currently asks for Admin rights, our policy is to grant it to them without needing to check with other parties for approval. Follow these steps to grant them access:

1.  The user will most likely include the event they are requesting Admin rights to. If they don’t clarify which one.
2.  On the Event Card, click on **Edit Leadership**
    - Search for the user with their first/last names or call sign and click the user or press enter when they are highlighted.
3.  If they show up on the right side as a Designated Event Leader, they are now added.
4.  Follow up with the user to let them know that they have Admin rights to that Event.

## Who does this process?

- Ashley
