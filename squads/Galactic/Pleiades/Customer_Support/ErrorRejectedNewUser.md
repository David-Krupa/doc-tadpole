# Error: Rejected New User

There is a known error that affects some users who are attempting to hit WIDOW for the first time after their P1 profile creation.

Typically, we are notified via Ralphie as they DM him when they get a "constant loading screen" for WIDOW instead of automatically being created as a user.

What to Look For from the User:

- "Constant loading screen"
- "Can’t access WIDOW"

Workaround:

1.  Have the User ensure that their P1 profile is filled out AS MUCH as possible (note the required fields) at this link: <https://login.dso.mil/auth/realms/baby-yoda/account/>
2.  Note whether or not the User exists in WIDOW yet in the admin view:
    - <https://widow.apps.dso.mil/admin/auth/user/>
    - If they DO exist and still can’t access <http://widow.apps.dso.mil/>, inform them to wait and DELETE their WIDOW account (only minor profile data loss)
3.  After the User has confirmed their profile is up to date, they should CLEAR their cache in CHROME or their current browser.
4.  Finally, have the User navigate to <http://widow.apps.dso.mil/> again. Their account should be created automatically and be authorized for general site navigation.

If any of these steps do not work, please notify a Team Lead and
escalate the issue.
