# \[DRAFT\] - Slack Usage Guide

## Benefits of Slack

Slack is a great instant messaging tool with a beautiful brand, great UX, and tons of integrations. It’s a great way to follow up on projects, give remote teams a feeling of "buzz," and keep team morale high with some of the latest gifts the GIF world has to offer.

## The Dark Side of Slack

As our company scales, Slack can often feel disorganized, or even a bit chaotic. It can be hard to find previous conversations, it feels like we need to be online 24/7 so we won’t miss anything, and the constant pings of notifications create tons of context switching and prevent deep work.

Jason Kolb, the former CTO of Uptake charted the journey of Slack as their company scaled:

- **4–10 people: **"**This is great**. I can set up channels for all the different activities we’re involved in and dip in and out as needed."
- **10–20 people:** "Hm, this channel setup isn’t working that great, let’s **reorganize** and set up some private rooms
- **20–50 people:** "Wow, this is getting **noisy**. Better pare down the channels I’m subscribed to."
- **50–100 people:** "This is turning into a monster, **completely unmanageable**. I wish people would email me things they actually expect me to read."
- **100–150 people:** "I have Slack installed but I never check it. It seems to be working great for other people, but if you need me you’d better email me."
- **150–400 people:** "My god what have we done. This is seriously **draining overall productivity**. How do we get rid of it now?"

## Where do we go from here?

To protect the time, energy, productivity, and overall happiness of the team, I’m proposing some new Slack usage guidelines that will help our team stay focused on work that matters while still being able to respond to matters that require faster triage.

Long-term, I believe we should consider moving to a communication tool that is better suited for remote teams and asynchronous work such as [Twist](https://medium.com/balance-io/why-we-switched-from-slack-to-twist-43dfdddbe1ba).

# Slack Guidelines

## Turn Off Push Notifications

We strongly encourage you to **turn off push notifications for Slack**.

We're a deep work culture, and Slack notifications can be disruptive. We do encourage you to **enable email notifications** for direct messages, which will help you with triage in the event someone requires your response to something in Slack.

Best practice is to check Slack a few times a day. If someone needs to get ahold of you urgently, they have your phone number and they'll text or call you. We think you'll find that very few things are actually urgent and a delay of a few hours does not cause problems.

There are exceptions to this rule. For example, if there's a thread in the engineering channel actively working on a system outage, you may want to turn on notifications for that channel if you think you can contribute to an ongoing issue, but it's generally best to enable push notifications only for that one channel rather than enable them by default.

## Use @Mentions

**It is not an expectation that every person on the team will read every post on every channel on Slack**.

If you have an update that needs to be read by someone, you should @mention that person. Do not assume certain people will see the update just because it's posted in the channel.

## Avoid Direct Messages

**Avoid using direct messages or private channels**.

Most conversations are better had in an open channel or synchronously on a phone call. Don't be worried about "spamming" a channel with lots of communication between team members We want to hear from you and seeing what everyone is working on makes the company feel more alive, which is important in remote teams. Just be sure to **use threads** to keep things manageable.

## Do Not Assign Tasks

**Slack should not be used for triage**.

If you have a task that you need someone to do, you should send them an email. Slack is great for updates and FYIs (for your information), but because it's a firehose of information, assignments will always get lost if they're given in Slack. Use a tool like GitLab, JIRA, or email if you need to give someone an action item.

## Slack Data is Ephemeral

Assume that everything posted in Slack is temporary and will be **deleted after 30 days**. Slack is not a repository of historic information or a source of truth—it's meant to facilitate short-form communication and reduce friction. For any type of information that might be needed at some point in the future of the company, that information should be sent written in [doc-tadpole](https://github.com/braingu/doc-tadpole) or a Google document.

## ?? Hour SLA for @Mentions

We appreciate and encourage deep work, so **there is no expectation that you need to immediately respond to messages you receive on Slack** 😁 We should use Slack as a tool for asynchronous communication, not instant messaging. But if someone is pinged with an @mention, it is reasonable to expect a response within ?? hours.

- Need to figure out what a reasonable SLA is for our team
