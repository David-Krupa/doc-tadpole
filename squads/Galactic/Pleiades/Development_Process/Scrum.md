# Scrum

## Intro

This document is meant to explain:

- [what Scrum
  is](https://braingu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BG/pages/1797488641/Scrum#About-Scrum)
  (at a high level), and
- [how Team Pleiades utilizes
  it](https://braingu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BG/pages/1797488641/Scrum#Squad-Dangerous-Sprint-Process)

so that each team member has a thorough understanding of whatâ€™s expected.

# **About Scrum**

## Sprint Cadence

We have decided to implement a 2-week sprint cadence, which we believe to be the ideal balance between allowing the teams to focus on their work uninterrupted for a meaningful amount of time, while still remaining agile to respond to customer feedback quickly.

## Scrum Cycle

You can find a brief guide on Scrum and the Scrum Cycle here: <https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/how-scrum-team-works/>

## The Three Pillars of Scrum

Scrum uses an empirical approach in order to adapt to the changing requirements of the customer. An empirical approach means working in a fact-based, experience-based, and evidence-based manner, and in particular, progress is based on observations of reality, not imaginary plans and ideals based on a large number of upfront requirements.

In short, we can learn and improve upon past mistakes and experiences. The three pillars of Scrum that uphold every implementation of empirical process control are:

1.  **<u>Transparency</u>** - Scrum promotes transparency as it requires significant aspects of the process to be visible to those responsible for the outcome. These aspects are defined by a common standard so observers can share a common understanding of what is being seen.
2.  **<u>Inspection</u>** - Timely checks on the progress toward a sprint goal to detect undesirable variances. The frequency of inspection should not be such that the inspection gets in the way of the work.
3.  **<u>Adaption</u>** - With Agile, we always embrace and adapt to changes, so that we can constantly improve. Adaptation means that with each sprint that we execute, we change what does not work or what could work better by constantly.
