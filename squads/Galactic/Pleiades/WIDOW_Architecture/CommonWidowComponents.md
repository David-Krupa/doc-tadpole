# Common Widow Components

### Purpose

Document common widow components as they are created in order to increase visibility and application standardization, as well as decrease duplication. Developers should add to this document as new common components are created.

### What is a common component?

A common component is one that is expected to be used in multiple places in the application. An example of a common component is the roundDeleteButton which is included in the list below.

Common components are also basic components such as a specialized button (again see roundDeleteButton). Larger composite components consisting of multiple other components would not necessarily be classified as a common component even if it was used in multiple places in the app.

How do you know if a component should be added to this list? Youâ€™ll have to use your judgement. A good candidate for this list would likely have several of the following qualities:

- Used in multiple parent components
- Is relatively small
- Is created by specifically styling and or composing one or more MUI components
