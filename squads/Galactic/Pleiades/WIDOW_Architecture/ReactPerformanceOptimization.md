# React Performance Optimization

## Purpose

- Discuss React component performance
- How to determine when performance optimization is necessary
- Present techniques to optimize and improve React performance

## Background

First, there is no hard and fast rule saying all code must be optimized to its highest level of performance. In fact, while creating the "perfectly optimized" component is a laudable goal, extreme optimization requires extreme amounts of time. Component optimization should be balanced against time to develop and user requirements.

## Prerequisites

Read the [React documentation on optimizing performance](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html).

## Basic Performance Optimizations

Well designed components and proper use is the first step to optimizing components. These steps include:

- Reduce the number of components rendered at any given time. Writing components to the DOM (a process called [reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)) is time-intensive. The fewer components that have to be written the faster the app can be.
- Virtualize long lists of components. This is discussed in the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html).
- Not subscribing a component to any more state than is required. This includes state passed as props, obtained from Redux, or state that is local to a component. This is because .
- Providing a proper [non-changing "key" for lists](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys) of React components. React uses the key prop to help determine if a component is the same instance as in a previous render. This influences Reactâ€™s decision on if the component requires a re-render.
- Do not render a disabled MUI component when simple text will suffice.

## React Profiler

The React Profiler can be used to help determine if there is a performance problem. It can also help find the source of the problem.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00RoZflFE34> by Ben Awad discusses using the React Profiler and using React.memo to prevent excessive component re-rendering.

## MUI Specific

**Replace disabled interactive components with text when able**.

Interactive Material UI (MUI) components such as AutoComplete and TextField require more processing and rendering than a standard text label. For example, and AutoComplete component will create a selection list whether it is disabled or not. It is faster to display only the value that should be shown than a disabled AutoComplete, TextField, or other MUI component.

### Presentations

Excessive component rendering can be a source of React slowdowns. Preventing unnecessary rendering of child components can help solve this problem.
