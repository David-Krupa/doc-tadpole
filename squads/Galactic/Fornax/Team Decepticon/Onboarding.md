# Onboarding to Team Decepticon :wave:

![decepticon logo](./images/Decepticons.jpeg)

## What We Do :wrench:

Team Decepticon was created to tackle the problem of [Deconflicting](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/deconflict) assets and airspaces for the WIDOW application.

Our approach is generic and relatively low level. We solve the problem at a mathematical level first and optimize our algorithms second.

Building on our `braingu_deconfliction` library, we also work on `braingu_scheduling` which tackles the problem of scheduling assets, routes, or even inventory in a generic and optimized solution.
