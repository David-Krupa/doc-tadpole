## Q: What are your foundations around work ethic?


## A:

Spence’s parents are working class people; the measure of wealth is working two jobs, so he ended up being partially raised by his grandparents. He saw them working constantly to build the life that they wanted for themselves and for the kids, and he saw the sacrifice that took. He saw them do things that made them happy like planting gardens; they’d weed together and eat the produce together.

Things changed when Dad started his first side business. That helped Mom advance in her job and drop one side gig, then get into companies willing to train her and grow her position. Now she’s managerial and drives health & safety for her company. She’s not far from retirement but still not coasting, still pushing herself. She defines herself by being able to provide lift to the team.

Same thing with Dad. Sold that business, built a second job in addition to dayjob. About 15 years later he sold that, and some of that money was a loan to Spence to start BrainGu. Paid him back, which was really important. The concept of entrepreneurship as having freedom but also getting back what you put in. It’s one thing to work hard for someone who doesn't appreciate you; it’s another to work hard for growth. Entrepreneurship is more about autonomy and being a participant in the rewards of hard work.

That makes hard work worth doing. We’ve all gotten to the end and thought, “What was that for?” when the work was just a slog. I don’t want BrainGu to be that for anyone. He expects a lot, but he also intends to reward people in a way that is commensurate with effort.


## Q: Something beyond oneself — what do you see that being?

A:

Many people’s higher idea was their religion. Or community. Or family. In modern society, many people don’t have the connection to those things that would have existed 50 years ago. Especially, with Americans, there is an independence almost to revulsion about being beholden to anyone. What is it that people do that is the thing they can be a part of? Everyone has an employer or a team. They stick in to the awful for the team. He doesn't expect BrainGu to be someone’s spirituality, but it can be a conduit to have a positive impact on society. And hopefully be alongside people who care about them and who they care about.


## Q: How is the knowledge worker ecosystem different from other contexts?


## A:

*   Spence is biased on the knowledge worker front. He thinks you can feel a part of something if you’re the janitor or construction worker who built the building. “I did my part of that.”
*   Saw dad be a company president, but refused to have workers come in on weekends. He’s the one who cleaned the toilets on the weekends. If it doesn't get done, support work is critical. We only get upset when support work doesn’t get done.
*   It’s elitism to think those jobs should be a stepping stone to knowledge work.


## Q: How does culture factor into growing BrainGu?


## A:


### Leadership culture

*   Every quarter leadership creates a new document.
*   Having autonomy and authority to match your responsibility is important to Spence. If you expect anyone to get stuff done, you have to give them autonomy and authority. But he’s also often been “you have as much authority as you take.” Power dynamic is important to take into account. There’s a line there. Some people don’t push from below — you have to pull them up, move the line, explicitly make the bounding box bigger. Conversely, removing boundaries and rules to get stuff done, but you also have to use policy/procedure, because if there’s none, you have no consistency and people get bogged down by decision fatigue. Well-built policy creates efficiency, which is a scaling functionality.
*   Time to make smart exceptions to that policy. If you have leaders who are not willing or able to share their authority and autonomy down, then everything breaks down quickly. A well-functioning democracy is a fragile thing. It takes activation energy to get it there and keep it there, to avoid entropy.
*   It’s important to build culture at the upper levels that transfers to the lower levels. Essentially, a [level 5 leader builds leaders who build leaders](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/level-five-leadership.html). If you’re going to be successful, you inspire others to inspire others. He’s not there yet, but he aspires to that. It’s a lifelong pursuit. Different organizations, different organizational sizes, will push you out of your excellence and you’ll have to work your way up.
*   Leadership priorities right now — trying to get everyone’s principles out on the table and get everyone to agree. He and Matt had principles before, when they were less effective leaders. Looking at updating those now.
*   How to keep values and actions coupled? Lots of companies use values as a single adjective. What we’re doing with our leadership metrics now is trying to be very nuanced with them, to understand that trueness. Are there times when we aren’t going to tell customers the truth? NO. But are we going to tell the most positive truth? Probably. And that’s marketing. =) Are we going to egregiously separate the truth from what we want to be true? No. So we talk about integrity and not fictionalizing things. Being able to take the moral high ground and knowing we can back it up. He’s trying to get to where there are few loopholes in the Values, and for us to be honest with ourselves with what the values mean and don’t mean.


### Employee culture

*   Doesn’t have a strongly nuanced thing here. When they talk about a multidisciplinary individual — you don’t get to say it’s not your job. Lots of attitude things he looks for in an employee. Not moving couches, curiosity, willingness, interest in learning new things and applying them. When he ran tech interviews, he’d walk through someone’s resume. He’ll find something he knows a lot about, and he’ll ask questions until they say “I don’t know”. That shows they’re comfortable. Then “how would you work to solve this problem?” He’s looking for the word “google.” Not hung up on ego is really, really important.
*   They try to foster convo in the way the slack channels are organized. It’s explicitly stated in the teams. It’s your key as a tech lead to see if they haven’t committed something. Coach people into not being afraid. Even if it's ugly, we need to see what you accomplished today, because maybe we can help you out. It requires teamwork to do this. If they don’t change the behavior, you run into problems.
*   Formal process for enforcing healthy ways of working.
    *   Sharing your progress every day, multiple times a day. Information radiators. If you have a curious team, they’ll go look at what you’re looking at. If you’re not committing every day, then people won't have that chance to look at your code and give you the help you may need. When people are aware of each other’s work and remain passively engaged with that work, that yields good things. If you’re not sharing with the team, you’re not seeing what they’re doing, and you’re disconnected both in send and receive. This isolates you further and makes you less a member of the team.
    *   In times past and a smaller company, everybody just got it. With their current growth rate, it needs to be more explicit, even though he hates to use the word “mandated.” You make a branch, but people can still see that branch, and you can still toss people a link to it and ask for eyes on.
    *   The cringe is not technical; it’s all mental. What he’s seen be a real problem is someone junior teaming up with someone who is hugely experienced. If you came in cold, you’d think the more experienced person had all the answers. “I’m not going to pipe up, because he already knows, or I feel stupid.” Insecurity is an ego problem. Get over yourself, and also get over your perception of others. We’re a team and you’re part of that team, and if you don’t have knowledge, go ahead and ask on the side. But definitely ask. There are too many rabbit holes, so if you can get a 30 second answer, that’s a good thing.
    *   This is the thing leadership sees most often getting between a new person and their success. We (founders) measure success as a team thing, not an individual thing.
    *   Hiring/recruiting culture
        *   We’ve spent a lot of energy making sure the people we bring in are the right people.
        *   Going to need to “hire well/fire well.” When BrainGu was tiny, the risk of hiring the wrong person was too high. But when you don’t allow any risk, you keep yourself walled off from opportunities. If you can accept some risk for hiring the wrong person in, then offering them a kind severance and a thank you for trying will be hard for us, but the right move overall. In a relationship, you shouldn’t try to change someone in that way. Getting through all that strife is not the point ([Spencelow’s Hierarchy of Bees](https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/wiki/Spencelow%27s-Hierarchy-of-Bees)).
        *   It’s OK for people to not like how we are.
        *   For early history it was the friends and family network. The first ten or so employees had all worked together before. Then we started hiring friends and friends of friends. Also started looking through external recruiters.
        *   They recognized that diversity was a problem at ~15 employees or so because all white guys. So they started asking around. We got really wrapped up on it, and put so much pressure on it, it didn’t work. As soon as they stopped trying, they started to have more diversity. We still don't have that at leadership levels, but they’re aware of it and tracking. They’re not putting weird pressure on it, but finding the best people in the best ways, and not putting up roadblocks to non-white non-male folks.

    *   Kinda love that. How’s it working out for you?
    *   You see this in overall military or government circles. Why does someone who gets kept who is toxic for the workplace? Happens everywhere but is more studied in government. The answer always comes back to “they’re great at what they do” or “they have tribal knowledge” so we have to keep them around, despite demotivating everyone around them. But when you look at a higher performing org, people always say, “I’d rather have someone I could count on, rather than someone who will solve every problem.” part of that trust is someone knowing they’re at their limit. If someone can't get it done but say they’re going to, that’s not fun. That’s a bad surprise to have.
    *   Their interviewing process starts on the tech assessment with “can I get you to say you don’t know?”  You’re incentivized to exaggerate your ability. Do you have the confidence and ability to say “I don’t know that”? It’s really important for them. Then they test for how you reason with new information. They provide basics about that. Let me provide you with osme info, and then work through a problem with the info you’ve just received. How quickly can you assimilate and operate?
    *   They get into esoteric deep dark stuff. Someone in the room is probably the person who wrote the code that does the thing. If you say, “I have this tech” on your resume, cool, we’ll probably push on the boundaries of your knowledge on that. You use it every day, but what do you really know about it? We just keep getting deeper down the well until you get the chance to say “I don’t know” or you try to BS us, which is an immediate disqualifier.
