## Prioritizing the Client Relationship

Especially in federal contracting work, you run a very clear line about how it’s illegal to do any free work. Most companies under that line err on the side of having an issue or ticket or a minute amount of time to be billed for every single action. If you did a sample, you’d find that consultants that do that make more money, because they run out of funds faster. If they’re good and demonstrating the need, funds get replenished. But BrainGu does it a bit differently; we view the relationship and the problem in a higher regard than dollars made today. Pretty sure that’s been at our financial detriment, but we also wouldn’t have as good relationships as we have. So as soon as you factor in the value of a relationship, the business development aspect, what a client needs to see, what is the value of charging that hour, or, there aren't any guidelines on how generic you make milestones. Can you group the hours under the milestone? That pivot means that the government gets better value because they’re not being nickel and dimed, and we get a better relationship so they trust us for their next thing. Generally the industry has this figured out in presales, but in implementation, that sentiment is lost. The end result, we don’t have enough data to say that BrainGu is getting more business, but we definitely have better relationships, and that’s what we value more.

For example, tech leads need to understand the client’s needs, expectations, and delivery, and then match those beyond the letter of the contract. It needs to fall within the letter of the contract, but there is definitely room on either side. The downside to that is that it opens up BrainGu to risk. This relationship only works if clients trust BrainGu and BrainGu trusts the client, so that we know what we’re delivering has a high probability of acceptance.


## Defining Trust

We define trust from clients trusting us; that’s dictated by deliverables. Do you underpromise and overdeliver? Are you on time? For us trusting them, it’s about how passionate they are about their issue, and how mature their process is. A very passionate client with a very weak process can’t pay invoices on time. A very process-oriented client without much passion will reference every line of contract but not the spirit of what’s delivered. Ralphie (WIDOW) was highly passionate, with a mature process. We try to go after those kinds of clients, which changes the trust/risk factor.


### Misjudging the trust factor

You have to recognize who actually has control over the contract. Does Ralphie have the ability to approve/deny/move forward? No, he’s just an operator. Where we’ve misguided trust is where we’ve not had the right level of buy-in where a person trusts BrainGu but doesn’t control the contract, and we haven’t built trust with the person that does. Now, we build contract-holder relationships, and have a good understanding of where the decisions are made.


### Building trust in teams

It’s a delicate question, of how to get that trust. BrainGu at its core needs to have a good balance of being able to have fun with the people you spend 8 hours a day working with, but also knowing what lines not to cross. Usually you find each team’s dynamic is a bit different, depending on who’s driving that team. I don’t know if there is a way… the more you document what can and cannot be said, the less is said, because people are hesitant to talk about anything without checking the rules. So for juniors, it’s that building the trust that everyone is in it to make them successful, but also not put off by that, you should be able to have fun, and make fun of certain situations. Depending on personality types, some folks would see that as making fun of a certain person. Pecking order isn’t BrainGu, but there’s definitely a sentiment of being able to have fun and joke about situations that happened. If you missed a comma and worked on finding that for six hours, having someone say, “next time, maybe change your IDE” and give some tips… Making a good environment to work in, you have the trust that everyone has your best interest.

Conversely, if you do that with a senior, they'll quit. If they have a good understanding of what they’re doing, they don’t need high-touch management, they need empowerment and direction. The biggest lesson for team leads is knowing those two sides, and knowing where someone falls within it.

That type of trust takes time, and just assuming that that’s the way it’s always been for a new person coming in, will take time.


## Building a Culture of Leaders


### Building Leaders

He and Spence are bad at this because it’s weird to delegate.  We remind ourselves, and aren’t great at it still today, but we’re getting better. But for anyone coming up as a tech lead, this should be in the training process.

The exec team has talked about how someone becomes leadership track. Really, it’s at the next level of someone’s career path. Someone recognizes they have potential to lead a team of teams. One of the things we’re going to try to adopt is, when someone is at that level/or at that point, the other peers should also have a say in that process. Moving from a junior to mid to senior, really deals on the saving throws aspect. Working on getting better definitions.

The ethos and differentiator is going to fall on the tech lead over that specific squad. With BrainGu focusing on DevSecOps, the only division we have is between DSO and business development. In general, engineering is held the same way. But that’s part of the role of breaking down the categories. By having that classification, we have it documented.

We put lots of pressure on the tech leads, and that’s intentional. They’re the forefront of the work being done and the day to day client interaction. Overall client strategy, relationships, we abstract away, but if you’re dealing with the teams and the clients day to day, you’re the main person who has 100% context and how the engineering team is doing. The role of tech lead is a really a form of what things you should be delegating to team leads, and how much time should be dedicated to client management, milestone delivery, and technical oversight. As projects get larger, you build tech lead staff members, so someone to assist with PM duties, reporting, buildout, or someone to assist with a specific SME if you have a ton of architecture work. It’s not an easy position, but has the biggest impact.

How do we motivate? We don’t inspire people to do it. The people who want to will naturally move towards it. There’s a line there about not pigeonholing someone into a skillset, but if you have someone perfectly happy coming in, getting work done, and only caring about their team, pushing them outside of that results in promoting people into being ineffective. Not everyone is going to be a tech lead. Recognizing the people that have that drive is kind of the duty — they know someone who has the qualities they need.

There’s some frustration there. We tried to force that process, and enforce that drive to lead, and were pretty disappointed with the result of that. That’s fine, and we have a pretty good spot to make a balance. When we’re hiring, this is the cultural fit beyond technical fit. If we have a lot of happy hobbits, and we know a tech lead will transition out, we need to hire those, not more happy hobbits.

Right now, we’re remediating burnout with 1:1s. That tech or team lead’s manager flags when they’re burned out, or reaching it. BG in the past focused a lot on post-indicators rather than pre-indicators. And we’ve made a big effort in having the biweekly 1:1s be the gauge for that.

Teams > squads >squad lead > people tangential to that > don't have it defined. Exec team (making BrainGu work). Right now, squad Dangerous, led by him. Squad Relativity led by Tim, Squad Barrel Roll led by Spence, bizops squad Brains led by Spence as well. As it is today, the exec team is its own boss. It’s our job to watch each other.


#### Recognizing burnout

Recognizing burnout is recognizing demoralization, or they don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. Some people, burnout is fixed by working more. For some folks, it’s to step away. It’s the responsibility of the person doing 1:1s to recognize and fix. At the project level, we’re setting expectations. We’re not going to be going 150% all the time, but some of the time. Going less sometimes is ok, with recognition that if there’s a need, you’re going to step up. Speaking as someone leading 3-month 150% step ups, it should last that long. One month is the max.


### Debrief culture

Matt’s a big believer in debrief culture and constructive feedback on code/approach/messaging
#### How do you implement that? How do you teach your people to implement it?

*   He’s not yet. He’s just a big believer of. He hasn’t found a good mix of how to do that with the personality types we have. He’s still in the testing ground of that himself, changing how he provides feedback to see if there’s a common way that handles the type of engineers they have.
*   His current line of thinking is that setting up debrief culture is hard because it’s new and it’s awkward. But the more you do it, the less awkward it becomes. When it becomes less awkward, it becomes more frequent, then having a debrief isn’t an issue, it's just expected, and you realize that it doesn’t reflect on you as a person, it’s just a course correction. But people view it personally, because humans have emotions.
*   He thinks guardrails come into play in the messaging, and looking for the reasons why decisions are made, rather than telling people they made the wrong decision. And then by understanding the why, you can determine if the why logic needs updating, or if it was an implementation issue. The what is always whatever was delivered. It’s really about not saying something is wrong, it’s understanding the decisions they made to choose it. I think from a power dynamic and stuff, that comes into play when you’re attacking the “what” of what was delivered, and you start with “this is garbage and unacceptable.” versus, no one here is delivering stuff at a garbage level intentionally. They think it’s good, so why do they think that?
*   This is implicit -- we don’t do a great job of training it. We do it through how we debrief. We’re leading by example, but we don’t teach.


#### How is a debrief structured?

Daily, with any merge request. You should be syncing with a team lead to go over it, so you understand why they built things the way they did. From a contract level, we lost a contract recently we were really shooting for. Debrief was had on their feedback, and what the decisions were that led to it and how we could change in the future; what was in and out of our control. Slows down process, but sometimes those debriefs are just a slack message. Sometimes, they’re a request for more sync.



*   End of cycle reviews are pointless, and you have to get it out the door, so you’re not providing feedback, you’re just going to push it all up and hope it works.
*   We need to do it more across the company, because when there’s code and something to review, that’s easy to debrief. When we have a lot of folks in advisory setup and there aren’t a lot of tangible things to point to, it’s harder to debrief, unless you’re just cc’d everywhere.


## What sets you apart, from a leadership perspective?



*   Very high standard that he expects and he’s trying to get better to guide people to meet those expectations. Standard comes with a lot of delegation and empowerment in order to have them do their jobs in the best way they can. He’s also been told that he’s too analytical. (maybe heartless, but somewhere between that), not really having a lot of emotion when it comes to business decisions.
*   Regardless of what people try, emotion does get factored in. People are hesitant to make decisions that affect them emotionally. If a decision is going to affect you, even if you try to take emotion out of it, emotion slows you down. He’s usually quicker to decisions than most because of the lack of emotion.
*   He worries a lot more about the details of how things are implemented, rather than the vision. He cares a lot more about the how than the why.
*   Spence would have a whole book of ideas, and he would say at least 50 of them have been whole companies around those ideas. Back in the day, he’d solution out ways to implement it. Spence would say “we’re not ready for that, we need a team and a staff….” If we were tied into venture capital, we could have started and sold multiple businesses by now. Spence has the ideas, and Matt implements them.
*   It’s him asking when the detailed plans will be done. Otherwise it’s a constant march to the vision, rather than a march to a deadline with a deliverable.


## What sets you apart, technically?



*   Experience. And running through so many common problems of projects, client expectations, client issues, technical gotchas you’d think made sense until you get deeper into the implementation. He also just has a very good ability for finding how things work in a massive solution. Before WIDOW, before federal work, in commercial work, it was not uncommon that he would go between six languages across 50K lines of code. He’d have no context but “fix it.” Very quick “hop into a dumpster fire and put it out” consulting has given him a lot of insights. Then, you extrapolate how those happened, then build out so they don’t.
*   The brain is a muscle. You train it enough, and things become muscle memory.
*   He’s always been a very big follower of the different stress studies. How does stress affect your mental state and health? Lots of fascinating studies on death rates based off of stressful jobs, given their demographic and how they perceived stress. If they thought of stress as awful, it kills. But in demographics where stress gives your life purpose, you think of it as a thing that gives you euphoria because you conquered. Those death rates are lower and people live longer. He’s always followed that kind of principle. “Stress is what you make of it.” Getting people out of their conditioning around this is really hard.
*   Massive experience in different programming languages also helps.
    *   It was never an option to be really good in one or two languages because every job changed languages.
    *   “Figure it out” is just having amazing google fu. Knowing what terms to use, what languages compared to other languages.  Knowing core programming principles. Pass by reference, pass by value, vs compile vs runtime. How languages work. That dictates going from a compiled language like C# or Java to Python, or to a non OOL like F# or LISP, or to a ridiculous language like COBOL.
    *   Before Git was a thing, using SVN, having to go through a 12K COBOL file checking for periods. He moved it into Word. You could do F&R to make a specific character change font size. He made all the periods 30 pt size so he could see them all.
*   He learned regex when he was like 11, so he just knows them. So he uses them every day, to build different things that would take people a lot of clicks otherwise.
*   Most of the time, for hiring at BrainGu, we’re pretty agnostic. They have to have core principles, but, with some projects in-flight and super fast-paced, need to ramp up quickly, they have to have the prerequisites. Ramping up afterwards doesn’t work.
    *   It can be problematic to hire new folks, because DoD work requires a different type of lifestyle. That limits our tech pool. Our recruitment has gotten a lot less picky over the last few years due to necessity, and making the adjustment so that if someone has potential, we would be able to figure it out later.
    *   When Sam does tech interviews, in the history of BrainGu, Sam has said “yes hire this person” maybe twice. Every other thing he usually says, “they could do the job, but…” or he says “Nah, not a good fit.” Now, we’ve transitioned to Sam’s “but” that’s a yes. Sam knows basics, but also how processes and tech works in order to apply basics holistically. Basics are a foundational block, not a stone. Since he has a wide depth of knowledge in all processes, he has foundation in all of them. Knowing the basics and being able to abstract and then apply; that’s the thing that’s hard to find.
    *   We’re not egoless, but we’re more humble than most.
