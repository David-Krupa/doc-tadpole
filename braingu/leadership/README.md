## Introduction

Leadership — the art of being a good leader applied practically — is something that is craved by individuals and organizations equally. True leaders build healthy, highly cohesive, highly functional teams. Teams that work harder, accomplish more, and enjoy greater levels of happiness and satisfaction across all aspects of their lives, than those who are simply serving under a “manager.”

There is an often misunderstood distinction between “managers” and “leaders” which I hope to address here. Simply put: **_Managers tell while Leaders inspire_.** In this document I will walk through some of the patterns and anti-patterns of leadership.

This document is by no means a canonical listing of behaviors or characteristics that make up a good leader. Rather, it should serve as a starting place for junior leaders, or those wishing to become leaders to begin their journey. It will also serve as a calibration point for intermediate and senior leaders who are responsible for larger parts of the organization, or those that have been leaders for a long time and may have fallen out of practice in certain key areas.

Leadership is a journey. An iterative process that continually changes and evolves. A good leader is always learning, they never **arrive**.


### Leaders are not born; they are made

**_Leadership is not a title or a position. Leadership is the conscious decision to look after the person to the right of you and the person to the left of you. _**

There are leaders at all levels of an organization and leaders come in all shapes and sizes, and there are many biological and anthropological reasons why people naturally gravitate to leaders, but the bottom line is that leadership is a choice.

A tribe is defined as “a social division in a traditional society consisting of families or communities linked by social, economic, religious, or blood ties, with a common culture and dialect, typically having a recognized leader.” In other words, a tribe is a circle of trust and belonging that unifies a group to provide protection from danger.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/blob/master/images/leadership/TrustCircle.png" alt="Circle of Trust" width="500">
</p>

Evolutionarily speaking, a leader has three primary roles

1. To determine who gets in and who doesn’t.
2. To determine how big to make the circle of belonging.
3. To win, elevating the tribe’s status.

Being a leader can come with many perks. Groups naturally elevate and give deference to their leaders. Evolutionarily speaking this comes from early human history when the leaders, the alphas of the group, were given the first choice of food after a hunt and the best shelter for rest. The idea being that if the biggest and strongest of the group were given the best food and were taken care of by the tribe, they would continue to be the biggest and strongest and thus be best able to protect the tribe from danger. Able to win.

This is why today, generally speaking, no one gets upset about the fact that their boss makes more money, or has a nicer office or home than they do.

However a position of leadership comes with a steep personal cost, and brings with it a heavy burden.

**The cost of leadership is self interest.** If you are not willing to give up your perks when it matters, then you probably shouldn’t be promoted — you might be an authority, but you will never be a leader.

Similarly, you don’t get to do less work when you become a leader, you actually have to do more work. That “more work” that you have to do is put yourself at risk to look after others. That is the anthropological definition of a leader. In history, you see this as alphas, the leaders of a tribe, running towards danger in defense of the tribe.

In business we often get this backwards.

For example, the military gives medals to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may gain. Whereas in business, we give bonuses to people who are willing to sacrifice others so that we may gain…

Wouldn’t you like to work in an organization where you have the absolute confidence and absolute knowledge that other people that you may or may not know that work in the same organization as you would be willing to sacrifice themselves so that you may survive?

That is the difference that leadership makes.

Leaders remove individual ego and personal agenda. It’s all about the mission. How can we best get our team to most effectively execute the plan in order to accomplish the mission?


### Managers vs. Leaders

There is a strong, but often misunderstood distinction between “managers” and “leaders.”

In its most simple form: **_Managers tell while Leaders inspire_**.

True leaders are able to build highly cohesive highly functional teams that work harder, accomplish more, and enjoy greater job satisfaction, with far lower rates of burnout, than those that are simply ‘managed’.

Leaders exemplify integrity and inspire trust and respect in their subordinates as well as their bosses.

A leader absolutely never asks their subordinates to do anything that they are unwilling to do themselves. Likewise, a leader is never above doing the smallest or most menial tasks in support of the mission and the team.

Good leadership is contagious. Everyone wants to work under good leadership, and peer managers will often see the successes of good leaders as something to emulate.

Leaders, you have a deep responsibility to care for the subordinates entrusted to you. You hold people’s livelihood, and sometimes lives, in your hands. You are trusted with a great amount of influence over the lives of your subordinates; a great burden that should be carried with the utmost reverence and humility.


### Ownership

Whether a team succeeds or fails is all up to the leader. The leader’s attitude sets the tone for the entire team. The leader drives performance — or doesn’t. And this applies not just to the most senior leader of an overall team, but to the junior leaders of teams within the team. **There are no bad teams, only bad leaders. **

When leaders drive their teams to achieve a higher standard of performance, they must recognize that when it comes to standards, it’s not what you preach, it’s what you tolerate. When setting expectations, no matter what has been said or written, if substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable — if there are no consequences — that poor performance becomes the new standard. Consequences for failing need not be immediately severe, but leaders must ensure that tasks are repeated until the higher expected standard is achieved.

Ultimately, sound leadership requires knowing when to cut someone loose that can’t perform in a team.

We must constantly be evaluating our team’s performance. If we aren’t winning, then we aren’t making the right decisions. And the fault for this lies with the leader, as does the responsibility for course correction.


### Communication

Humans, and by extension businesses, are not rational. Human relationships are about feeling safe. That is why communication and empathy are critical to a leader’s success.


#### Listening

Effective communication starts with **active listening.** Modern American conversation patterns often have people formulating their response or next statement while the other party is talking. This gives the perception that conversation is moving quickly, and minimizes the “down time” in a conversation to give us the feeling of control over the conversation. Listening, true **listening with the genuine intent to understand**, is actually the key to beginning to control a conversation and drive to a successful outcome. When you listen, you actually come to know twice as much as the other party in the conversation; you know what you already know, _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">plus</span>_ you know what the other person knows as well.


#### Time

Human beings put a premium on time whether subconsciously or consciously, because it is an equal and non-redeemable commodity. For instance, if you spend money you can make more money, but if you spend time, you’ll never get it back. Because of this, a leader’s time is one of the most important relational tools in your inventory. However, leaders are often getting pulled in a dozen different directions at once, which makes the time expenditure of the leader in an intentional and focused manner all the more significant.

When thinking about communication, the are two extreme ends of the spectrum: Rational and Emotional

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/blob/master/images/leadership/emotionalspectrum.png" alt="Emotional Spectrum" width="500">
</p>

Rational communication tends to be transactional in nature and driven by logic. An example of rational communication would be: “If X is true, then Y is also true, and therefore Z is false”. Most business communication tends to take place near the rational end of the spectrum. At this end of the spectrum communication is much more analytical and personal empathy is low.

Emotional communication is the far opposite end of the spectrum. This type of communication is not driven by logic, but by emotions, feelings, and perceptions. In times of crisis, emotions rise and people naturally swing towards the emotional end of the spectrum. When operating on this end of the spectrum, listening and empathy are crucial.


#### Emotional Intelligence

_The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically._

As a leader, you need to be introspective and aware of where you are on the emotional spectrum, and you must exercise emotional intelligence to be aware of where other parties on the emotional spectrum, and engage them appropriately. Often we have the perception that when engaging with highly emotional people, you should take as much emotion out of the interaction as possible, when in fact the opposite is actually true. If you take emotion out of your responses, that causes you to appear cold and uninterested, which will further escalate the other person. When you are engaged in a highly emotional interaction, you should actually mirror some of that emotion, albeit at a slightly lower level to cause a natural de-escalation of the situation.

When mirroring emotion, it is critical that you don’t direct it back at the other person; that will cause a fight and escalate tensions.

Practically, when it comes to working with others in your organization, you should continue the continuum of rationality in parallel with the emotional spectrum when communicating.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/blob/master/images/leadership/continuumofrationality.png" alt="Continuum of Rationality" width="500">
</p>

Example: Email is a rational tool. Don’t answer emotional questions through rational tools. Pick up the phone, jump on a VC, or walk over if possible and speak in person.

Regardless of the tool used, effective and direct communication must be

*   Clear — the intent of your message needs to be clear and easily understood.
*   Concise — use the minimum words necessary for a clear message.
*   Accurate — leaders must maintain ultimate integrity.
*   Confident — the message should be strong. The leader must be communicating from a place of belief in the message.


#### Leading up and down the chain of command

One of the most important jobs of any leader is to support your own boss. Leadership must always present a united front to the employees. A public display of discontent or disagreement with the chain of command undermines the authority of leaders at all levels. This is catastrophic to the performance of any organization.

As a leader, if you don’t understand why decisions are being made, requests denied, or support allocated elsewhere, you must ask those questions up the chain. Then, once understood, you can pass that understanding down to your team. Leaders in any chain of command will not always agree. But at the end of the day, once the debate on a particular course of action is over and the boss has made a decision — _even if that decision is one you argued against _— you must execute the plan as if it were your own.

The major factors to be aware of when leading up and down the chain of command are these:

*   Take responsibility for leading everyone in your world, subordinates and superiors alike.
*   If someone isn’t doing what you want or need them to do, look in the mirror first and determine what you can do to better enable this.
*   Don’t ask your leader what you should do: tell them what you are going to do.


#### How do you win with people you don’t like?

When you lead within an organization, it is inevitable that you will have to work with people that you simply don’t like. It is important to build (productive) relationships with people so that you can have more influence across your team, organization, and company.

There are a couple of practical things to keep in mind when you’re interacting with people you don’t like

*   Don’t be a jerk; you’ll make things worse.
*   Don’t undermine; carry yourself with humility. Try and build a relationship instead of being antagonistic.
*   Most of the time when you “don’t like” someone, it’s because your ego is getting in the way.
*   To quickly check your ego, ask yourself “If I am so smart, why am I not winning?” If you are answering that question honestly, you will put your ego in check.
*   Ask yourself, “Is this going to help the relationship or hurt it?”


#### What about dealing with people that lack common sense?

Common sense is the blanket term we use that covers a person’s natural ability to make good decisions.

To help improve someone’s decision making, you need to teach them how to

*   Step back and detach. You cannot understand a complex and dynamic landscape when you are deep in the weeds and focusing on the ground level.
*   Analyze and determine courses of action and understand the consequences of action (including second and third order effects). Nobody wants to make bad decisions on purpose, however when poor decision making is observed, it usually stems from a reasonable decision being made on the ground without the understanding or consideration of the downstream effects.
*   Mitigate risk. Understand your assets and resources and where they can be applied to minimize the threat surface and unintended downstream effects.

Good decision making isn’t something that can be learned through reading or observation alone, it is developed through doing. Therefore, if you have someone that doesn’t seem to exhibit a lot of common sense, the best thing you can do is to put them in charge of something that is **just** outside of their competency. As you give these people a little bit of space to make decisions, you need to gently correct their mistakes, and help them understand the decision making process rather than smacking them for making a bad decision.


### Some behavioral patterns of a leader

The phrase “not my job” doesn’t exist in our vocabulary

We individually accept responsibility for outcomes, both successful and unsuccessful.

When things go wrong, the only place we look to point the finger is at ourselves, individually.


### Perfection

There is no such thing as perfection. It’s a lesson all elite organizations understand. Perfect execution cannot be achieved. Instead of searching for it, they define perfection as finding and fixing every mistake. Perfection is setting your ego aside and explaining to your team what you did wrong. Perfection is building a culture where your team is willing to expose every error, even those that could be hidden or ignored. Perfection is creating a team that competes over whose fault it is when a project fails or when goals aren’t reached.

It’s time to redefine perfection. Perfection is about mistakes. You must teach your mistakes to others so they learn them in the classroom, the boardroom, and the debrief. You must teach your mistakes to others so they don’t make them in combat, on a sales call, during a negotiation, or when fighting a fire, running a business, or leading a team.
