## Background

When BrainGu was just starting, the team needed ways to communicate boundaries, and answer the question “do we want to do this?” Talking about technology was easy, but discussing management and employees and people was a little harder. Brent developed what became the Brent Triangle as a way for people to communicate better around “what makes me happy for a job I want to do.” It evaluates the _impact level _of a potential action. This is a simple gut check which helps the team determine where to focus energy, and which things to avoid.

The Brent Triangle drives compromise in communication, between an ask about what they would be content doing day to day, and moving that into a business sense, about what makes BrainGu happy. Is the project going to have a big impact, be a big challenge, or make a lot of money?

The tool is opinion-based; what may be interesting technology for the dev team may not be the same for the biz ops team — it’s very open to interpretation. It’s also supposed to be used to evaluate how a given action is impacting us *now*. Additionally, the Triangle can be used to qualify leads to determine what opportunities to pursue, and provides us with a framework to re-evaluate how a project’s impact has evolved over time.

The Brent Triangle is always presented on every slide for every project at SitRep. This makes the Triangle something the whole team gets exposed to. When a project is updated, every employee can see how the project is being impacted and how BrainGu is being impacted.


## Decisionmaking

The following questions, and the answers to them, may be helpful to think through while considering your rankings on the Brett Triangle.

*   How do I work?
*   Is this contract making us learn something — is it new, different, in my wheelhouse or no?
*   How do I feel it’s benefiting me?
*   How interesting will this be over time? We can work on a tech stack, but after five years it may not be really interesting.
    *   Virtual machines are a great example. In the past, people did everything in VMs to isolate on a system level. Not unique any more and is not technically exciting compared to containers, but it still has its place. In five years Kubernetes won’t be exciting either.
    *   Is there an opportunity to lead people out of using legacy stuff? We’d prefer to continue evolving, as opposed to being stuck with the old patterns.


## Criteria

Each of the following three criteria are ranked on a scale from 0-3.

*   **0** = negative or zero impact
*   **1** = below average impact
*   **2** = average impact
*   **3** = above average impact

**Mission:** The impact a given action would have on the success of a customer’s mission and/or BrainGu’s mission.

**Engagement:** The impact on personal and/or team success the expected outcome of a given action would bring.

**Financial:** The expected positive financial impact of an action in comparison to the level of resources expended.


### Breaking Down: Mission

_"The impact a given action would have on the success of a customer’s mission and/or BrainGu’s mission."_

```
Examples: Accomplishing a goal within a difficult time window which other
teams could not do, creating a mission supporting capability that did not
previously exist, clear and present improvement to life and death
circumstances.
```


Measuring mission impact is a two-tiered process that requires



1. measuring _how_ the opportunity is impactful, and
2. _who_ is impacted.
*   **How:** For a mission to be truly (positively) impactful, it needs:
    *   **_To be successful:_** the work needs to end up positively affecting the lives of customers outside the immediate delivery team.
    *   **_To be smart:_** The engagement is structured in a way that allows us to come in and do what we do best without having one hand tied behind our back.
*   **Who**: Depending on which perspective you’re approaching this from, it can change drastically. Where a mission’s impact is being felt in at least one of the following (these may not always be the same):
    *   _The Customer’s mission:_ This can be a lot easier to answer, because huge mission impact is clear, especially in law enforcement &mdash; helping to literally catch criminals. Overcoming a cool challenge with unique obstacles also counts.
    *   _The BrainGu mission:_ Are we growing? Are we being profitable? BrainGu’s mission is to incubate technologies. Knowledge transfer is a big mission impact.
    *   _The larger Industry/Community_

Be very clear when Mission is being discussed about which way it’s pointed. The default should always be pointing at BrainGu.


### Breaking Down: Engagement

_The impact on personal and/or team success the expected outcome of a given action would bring."_

```
Example: Challenging or interesting work that will be personally fulfilling,
working with a new technology that the whole team is excited to get their
hands on, getting a chance to prove some theory by being the most awesome.
```

Measuring _Engagement_ includes consideration of the following elements:


**_Sith Model_** &mdash; provides BrainGu employees with a support system (minimum of two people where at least one individual is senior in BrainGu culture, in addition to skill/experience, in order to provide mentorship/guidance to other team members).

**_Technology_**  &mdash; provides BrainGu technologists and engineers with the opportunity to use/learn cutting-edge technologies, or improve technical skills on particular technologies individuals have proficiency in. This takes into account the skillsets required for a project and how that matches the roles on a project.

**_Good Customer_** &mdash;  The relationship with the customer has to motivate BrainGu folks to want to work with this person/team. This takes into consideration how well their requirements match BrainGu’s flexibility ethos to include: core work hours, location, and qualification requirements (e.g., clearances)


### Breaking Down: Financial


_"The expected positive financial impact of an action in comparison to the level of resources expended."_

```
Example: An opportunity adds significant revenue and profit margin to the
company based on rates against expended costs on the project, opportunity to
grow the engagement, and the duration of said project.
```


_Financial Impact_ takes into consideration the following:

**_Profit Margin:_** &mdash; This is based on the duration of the engagement. Lower margins are acceptable if the duration of the engagement is high (shorter duration engagements justify a higher margin).

**_Number of Employees:_** &mdash; Flexibility is a plus here. BrainGu measures profit per person, not profit per project—allowing us to prioritize people instead of projects.

**_Skill-level Required:_** &mdash; Ideally, the project requires a mix of capabilities and skill levels.


### Final Score

Wherever possible, we seek to maximize impact. To determine the potential _impact level_ of an action, we add the three criteria scores together.

*   **&lt; 3:   Below Average Impact**
*   **3-5:   Average Impact**
*   **> 5: Above Average Impact**
