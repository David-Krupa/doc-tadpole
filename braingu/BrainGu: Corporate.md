## Lessons from Dad

*   **Employee-owned company**. (this is less a Dad thing, more about the company that Dad worked for for 8 years, Commonwealth. The story was big in his formative years growing up, as well as being formative as a business). The company was small, and had already been around for 16 years. Everyone who worked there had it very fresh in their minds what made them start the company. They had all been at a large firm of 1000 employees, which was owned and had concentrated power at the top of the firm. The majority of the shareholders got old and retired, and either sold their stake, or their inheritors did, to some New York-based firm, who subsequently told everyone to either move to New York, or have no job. It was so visceral for them, Spence felt like he lived it because of how many ways and times he heard that story. A handful of the (former) employees got together and made a company that could not be sold, asking the question of their attorneys, “How do you put the power in the hands of the employees?” So, they essentially put together rules. No one could own more than 10% of stock, and you had to be an employee to own stock. If you’re not an employee, irrevocable offer of sale on your stock. That approach to business was an interesting and appropriate democratization of the workplace — it’s unusual to have that power from the worker.
*   Many of us who came over form Harris had just re-lived an acquisition. The local power structure was now remote, and you have no communication with or understanding of them, and decisions that affect you are being made elsewhere. So we were inspired to take the Commonwealth approach, where the employees will own the company, be the board and shareholders, and workers, so incentives and outcomes are aligned with the inputs.
*   We have one person on the board that is not affiliated, to help us check our math and give us advice. Greg Rupprecht — works for Commonwealth.


## How does the board function, in the doing?

*   Hasn’t always been the most effective form of governance, because none of us has governed before, but also because we don’t have a top-down hierarchy. He’s on the board but he’s the CEO, He can short-circuit himself in that. The board has been more of an oversight function, and guiding. A month ago, they talked about how to be more strategically impactful, more forward leaning. Bring more external advisors in, but then be a steering committee. More like charting where the company should be going, but not to check where we’ve been. Too reactive; need to be proactive. That’s where Darkmode came from — how do we finally incubate something and what does it take to clean up these concepts? The board put in the thought work, tasked him to do research.
*   He appreciates not having to come up with everything, because he’s only one person and one brain.
*   Where we should go and what we should do are different contexts. Things we want to build and deliver. We don’t always lift our heads up to look down the road. Not suggesting that we do a full flip over. Maybe an 80/20 thing. Have to dedicate time to plan our future to make us better at delivering in the now.
*   When we were small, passive communication was no longer effective.
*   Board will sometimes say “we’re doing thing with benefits” so that’s a course correction. Non-confrontational. You just have the conversation about financial impacts, study the problem a bit.
*   We haven’t always been as explicit with vision. “Being an incubator” is vague, kind of useless, and intangible. In the board, we fail to constrain things, which makes them more communicable. That’s his hope with the Darkmode experiment. More clear vision. Help bring cloud native to companies that need to adopt them. When you have that, which is a more precise thing, then you can decide, “does this work, or does it not?”  A lot more work fits in that bucket than did before.
*   With a generalist staff of very smart people, the harder decision is “what don’t we do?” We could build rockets, submarines — they could do anything and have the drive to do so.
*   We aren't terribly good at saying no. That’s a weakness. Everybody gets to try ideas, but that needs to be timeboxed. Spend six weeks and evaluate, rather than turning loose.
*   Five domains: defense space education finance healthcare.
*   The point of incubating other businesses, you grow it enough to stand on its own, then make that more broadly adopted — problem for specialists rather than generalists. Did a project for Cancer Society. What they didn’t do is advance a technology. We just made them have a more successful management system.
*   Tactical vs strategic decision making.
