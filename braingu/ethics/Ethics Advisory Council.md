## Purpose

The BrainGu Ethics Council (#corp-ethics) is a standing committee to consider and advise on ethics questions that may arise in the course of BrainGu business. Eventually, as it builds maturity and a body of precedents, it can also provide guidance on high level rules of engagement to the executive team. The Council is a resource for both BrainGu management (providing resources for evaluating existing and new business) as well as individual BrainGu employees (providing resources on non-HR questions about their work).


## Structure

The Council will consist of at least four (4) but no more than seven (7) members, and will be chaired by a member of the Management Advisory Board. The Management Advisory Board shall appoint the chairperson for a 6-month term. The Council chair will nominate members of the Council, who will be confirmed by the Management Advisory Board for 3-month terms. The Management Advisory Board should take care that Council members reflect the full range of BrainGu business areas, stakeholders, and viewpoints. All Council members may be renominated at the conclusion of their term.


## Operations


### Meetings

The Council will meet in response to specific events, as well as, on an as-needed basis, in response to an organizational need or a request from BrainGu management or employees. The Council will have quarterly business meetings for a high-level review of recent events, strategic direction, and review of any necessary changes to Council artifacts (e.g. Ethics Survey and Framework). In addition, the Council will meet as needed to conduct ethics reviews, as required by Ethics Survey responses.


### Artifacts

The Council will publish various artifacts in its advisory capacity.


#### Ethics Framework

The Ethics Framework is a document laying out general policies that BrainGu considers when pursuing or continuing projects. It will consider types of work and types of customers, as well as how to weigh different factors. It may include high-level guidance that reflect general principles, as well as, bright-line rules.


#### Ethics Survey

The Ethics Survey is a document that presents questions along with a rating scale in a format that a BrainGu employee could use to evaluate a project. It is meant for use by anybody pursuing new work or evaluating a change in direction for existing work. The survey will include a method for calculating an “ethics score” along with thresholds indicating what, if any, additional action is needed.


#### Ethics Advisories

An Ethics Advisory is the end product of an ethics review, which considers the factors involved in the specific matter and contains analysis and recommendations. It will set out guidelines that indicate if the review determined anything not covered by the Ethics Framework, and it will make high-level recommendations to management and the Management Advisory Board as appropriate. Advisories should take care to include all perspectives on the Council, including any dissenting opinions or alternate analysis and ensuring that all stakeholder groups have their opinion represented.

The Council shall establish Standard Operating Procedures that will include a timeline for deliberation and evaluation of ethics matters.


#### Employee Ethics Climate Survey

The Ethics Climate Survey is a questionnaire that gathers feedback from BrainGu employees and stakeholders about their views on the type of work they and BrainGu should be supporting. It informs changes to the Ethics Framework.

Any BrainGu employee, member, or Management Advisory Board member may refer a matter to the Council. The Council will establish and publish a framework for evaluating questions before it.


## Transparency and Privacy

The Council will publish a framework for evaluating questions before it. The Council will respond to any individual raising a matter before it and may publish the consideration more broadly if appropriate. The identity of an individual referring a matter to the Council will be treated appropriately. The Council will report an appropriate summary of its work to the Board on a quarterly basis.


## Appendix A: Ethics Review Procedure

2. Manager completes Ethics Survey and submits results to Ethics Council.
3. If survey results do not require an ethics review, manager proceeds with tasks.
