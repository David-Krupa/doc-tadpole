## Leadership

It’s important for leadership especially in tech and government to come up strongly about ethics, because of the potential moral and ethical grey areas in this work. There’s a level of responsibility that comes from working on those kinds of projects that not everyone doing the work considers. One of the things that he’s always recognized is that BrainGu takes those considerations seriously, and makes those kinds of statements.

He hopes that it filters down to employees working on actual contracts that if they feel uncomfortable that they can bring it up to management or others. It’s a bad position when you work on something where you don’t feel you have the ability to make changes. If there are questions, there are ways to ask and people have the responsibility to make options for people who want to know what they’re impacting.


## Mentorship

Early on, a lot of us who came from a cybersecurity background, just kind of learned about the field and the surrounding consequences by being there. A few of his docs are the way they tried to share that knowledge with folks not from the same background.

When he first started after college, they put him on a contract part time doing testing. He didn’t know who the end customer was or how that software was being used. He had zero insight into what he was doing, and wasn't comfortable in that position. Coming out of that, he wanted to do what he could to make sure that BrainGu didn’t put people in that position to the extent possible.

He’s never seen an instance where BrainGu did something that he directly felt was ethically unacceptable or wrong. Sometimes something felt fishy, and they walked away from the deal.


## Power to the People

We should give people as much info to evaluate what they’re doing as we can. It’s not always easy being in an environment where you *have* to evaluate the possible consequences of your actions constantly, and you’re constantly having to figure out where the line is.

There aren’t any easy answers. Technical ethics training has gotten a lot better in the last five years. Significant realization that just because you’re at Facebook doesn’t mean that you’re free of ethical considerations of your work output. Most software engineers are way underequipped to handle those questions, unless they have philosophy or military studies.

Even civil engineers have to have at least one course in engineering ethics. A lot of Computer Science programs aren’t accredited as engineering, so don’t even have to have that one. But even then, reading it vs actually talking about it makes a huge difference.


## Asking Questions about Ethics

We used to do [walkthroughs of topical pieces and articles](https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/wiki/Ethical-and-Policy-Questions-in-Cybersecurity), getting into some of the meat of the things. There’s some really great reporting around hacking groups who found their software on phones of cartel people or whatever. We also had a board initiative for a system to eval projects to meet ethical standards and for managers to evaluate -- especially if it was classified.

It’s important for leadership especially in tech and government to come up strongly about ethics. There’s a level of responsibility that comes from working on those kinds of projects that not everyone doing the work considers. One of the ethings that he’s always recognized is that they all take those considerations seriously. It’s important for BrainGu leadership to make clear ethical statements about relevant events.


### [Company survey from 2018 on dual-use/sensitive technologies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MtTYbHx3x8yn-sMGiihPDvU9fOhrYxiL6wKc70qiWHo/edit#heading=h.m8t2atcn8o4n) ([source for questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QfmpVXG2gVdvVsTnN374dk0hhYqUY54wBs2kGc9ZCZo/edit))

Normally, the execs do an annual survey. As the company grew, it was useful to take the temperature of the company. Back in 2018 the company was different, in that there was a cybersec group and also a significant group that worked on enterprise software dev that had nothing at all to do with security.

When all the non-enterprise work went away, the company has refocused much more on specifically federal DevSecOps/security work. We had this sense that half the company wouldn’t have objected to the work but hadn’t thought about it or weren’t really paying attention.

The ideas in the mission statement document did exist before. The importance as a consulting company of putting on the right face for the customer and understanding that you talk to the customer differently than your internal manager, and differently from the prime contractor.


## Personal ethics vs professional ethics? The ethics of each individual engineer vs the ethics of BrainGu as a whole?

Yes. There’s a reason that we included a distinction between “I don’t want to work on this” and “I don’t want my company to work on this.” It’s possible to think that something is worthwhile and is a net good, without wanting to do it yourself.

Some might think that you’re trying to reduce your culpability.  There were a decent number of people who said “I don’t want to do this” but were OK with the company doing it. If everyone at the company thinks it’s fine for the company but they don’t want to do it, that’s important to know from a staffing standpoint.

There is some difference between a closely held corporation where the few owners can set standards vs. a public corporation where shareholder value is the primary responsibility. Even then, a consulting company is literally selling the reputation and quality of its employees, so there’s a business incentive not to have unhappy/fleeing employees.

You kinda hope that if things were that bad, we would have realized it beforehand. At the point at which no one wants to do it and no one wants BrainGu to do it… BrainGu would have all gotten in a room and have a discussion.

### How easy/hard is it for BrainGu to change course, when the dev isn’t happy with a project or a concept?

It varies based on circumstances (role, financial situation of the company, sales pipeline). It can sometimes take a while (>1 year) to move somebody off a contract. Subject to contractual limitations (key personnel), what work is available, and whether somebody else is available as a backfill.

Technical and ethical burnout are different, and people have to figure out for themselves. If you’re a manager, the only way to know is to be talking to your reports, and try to figure out why. Short of someone being in a place where they’re having ethical dilemmas and clearly wrestling with it, it’s hard.

Employees should recognize that they do have the ability to change projects or roles, but that it can take time and they should start talking to their manager in advance of when they want to do something else. If they wait until they already feel burned out, it might be too late.

You can't set up a framework and the framework runs itself. It doesn’t matter how many training docs you have if you can’t make people understand that those conversations are encouraged. There’s a good baseline in place, and people who’ve been at BrainGu a long time have thought it through, but the work is never *done*. Any answers or ideas from 2 years ago may not be valid now.


## Does participating in intellectual warfare have any lasting social effects?

You learn how to compartmentalize what to talk about with whom, but it isn’t unique. I expect doctors would do something similar. There are a lot of people who recognize conflict and are fine with it, and sleep well knowing their work is stopping terrorists.


### Facets of the “us” vs. “them” mentality

It’s the hope that closeness and strong team building would tend to guard against accidental sociopathy. Close groups of people are perfectly capable of anti-social actions too. Ideally team building without groupthink.

Quote from Reddit: “I knew that the vast majority of what was made was used for sporting purposes. I feel no responsibility for the malicious misuse of products I have a hand in. Now I build freeze dryers... Those can be used for manufacturing deadly viruses and whatnot. I have no control over the end-use. We have a list of countries we won't ship to, but we have no control over where they go after the customer takes shipment. Cars have often been used as weapons too: I don't see many automotive engineers losing any sleep over that.”

“Malicious misuse” is an interesting phrase. If you build a spy tool that you think is going to be used to stop terrorists but it gets sold to dictators who spy on journalists, I don’t think that counts as “misuse” even though it’s “malicious”. If I were an auto engineer and the car I worked on was used as a weapon then I would certainly lose sleep even though I wouldn’t be responsible in any way. Re: climate change, I do think that anybody building SUVs right now should be thinking carefully about the impact they are having.

### Is the person who builds the tool more culpable than the person who dictates how the tool is used?

No (assuming the person using it understands the effects to the same extent). But they aren’t necessarily much less culpable.

### Does engineering exploits ultimately make us all safer? (the red team argument)

Two parts to this: finding vulnerabilities to patch them, and building exploits for use to accomplish other goals (military/espionage). Finding vulnerabilities and patching them absolutely does vs. hoping that nobody will find them at all. For other purposes, I lean towards yes but other times it’s harder to say
