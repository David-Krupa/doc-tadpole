A Tadpole Project interview with Michael Kahn

## How did the BrainGu Ethics Advisory Council come to be?

*   The Board adopted the charter and decided to handle ethical issues itself until there was enough interest/scale to justify a separate group
*   The Council itself was just what they ended up with to answer what was the best structure to make sense of, and to study and answer these questions.
*   The council itself never existed beyond the charter. Would have had a subcommittee of folks who were interested. Not many volunteers. Rather than trying to rope people in, they let it go and made it a board responsibility.
*   Part of why he spent time on it and why the leadership wanted it is because of the need for it proactively.

## What inspired you to start it?

*   Caring that people have the ethical info to make decisions. He was on the board already. He likes being involved in the corporate governance already.

## What kinds of ethics training does the Board have?

*   Nothing that he’s aware of. For him and the other folks interested, it’s about reading popular materials.
*   Business Roundtable statement: Shareholder value should not be the end goal of every business decision.

## The Survey is a tool you intended to help people evaluate projects. Was the intent here to level the ethical assessment field, to impose impartiality on that which has the potential to be wildly impartial, or to shine the flashlight of ethics on BG projects?



*   Before his board term ended, he wrote up a draft.
*   Few different pieces
    *   Tension between wanting to have some guardrails without having a major impact on things moving. If the RFP is due in 10 days, and you have 20 days of work, then having an ethics discussion isn’t practical. Came up with the survey idea as a self-serve model. Rather than needing to go through a time consuming process that would slow sales, it shows you thought about it. If your score is higher than a certain level, you need input.
    *   The hope is to make the process more impartial and therefore more palatable.

    *   “Is this working for a government or commercial? If it’s government, do they have human rights abuses?” If you’re doing this thing for the EPA, it’s less moral hazard than if you’re doing it for the DoD. “If it’s for our government we don’t have to worry about it.”

    *   Not meant as oversight, but meant as a framework to think about things, for project managers who might not have been party to all the conversations. His primary goal was ease of use.


## At what level do you assert primary ethical relevance? Help a developer sleep at night, vs catching bad guys, vs staying solvent?

*   Some of all of that. He kind of took the easy out on the business angle, by focusing on advisory “how you make decisions” framework, and kicked the can down the road to actual management to make those tradeoffs. He presented the framework and relied on project management or BrainGu management to make decisions between grey area and business impact and what choices are appropriate there, with the hope that if everybody has some understanding of the issues, they can understand their own lines. They can speak up if they see something wrong, or identify a line they won’t cross. It’s important that they have the ability to identify as it happens before it's too late.
*   You should make a list of all the things you’d never do and keep it next to your resignation letter. The advantage of being a contractor is that it gives you that flexibility to walk.
*   At BrainGu, we accept certain compromises to achieve positive outcomes that we might not accept standalone. So think of a situation where you stick around because someone else might make other decisions. There’s a responsibility.
