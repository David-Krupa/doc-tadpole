## What is BrainGu?

BrainGu is a tech innovation lab.

## What is a 'tech innovation lab'?

A place where business, creativity and technology come together to assist organizations in realizing innovation. Basically, we solve problems!

## Who are the people behind BrainGu?

We gather people with experience in many different disciplines and perspectives to find new ways to look at existing problems. Our everyday goal is to help existing organizations get better and create our own organizations to fill the gaps we see in the world. The primary means by which we accomplish this is through applied technologies. BrainGu's members have experience in businesses large and small, academia, non-profits and the public sector. They are passionate about exploring multiple perspectives to move code along the path from good to great.

## How does BrainGu work?

We do it better, one step at a time, and have an impact. This is known as [Change the Box](5996549.html), and you can learn more about what that means [here](https://github.com/braingu/tadpole/wiki/handbook-for-the-impossible).

## What does BrainGu do?

Currently, BrainGu is solely focused on Cybersecurity Automation. This takes several forms, but the general idea is that we work on improving and scaling difficult, labor-intensive tasks across the cybersecurity field. We believe that the status quo isn't working and cannot scale without reducing the amount of human labor necessary to complete simple cybersecurity objectives. To accomplish this, our team has experience ranging across the various subfields of cybersecurity, as well as distributed systems, network administration, software engineering, and DevOps. Every day, we chip away at the hardest issues in the industry by making the work a little more automated. It's important to note that we don't wish to displace the humans from the equation, only to help them be more effective and free them up to focus on the sort work that isn't yet feasible for automation. This is sometimes called "[autonomation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomation)" &mdash; however, that term is less often used or understood in the cybersecurity industry.
