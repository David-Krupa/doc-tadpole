1. Approach problems in the context of their larger system.
2. Systems are never just technology.
3. Sometimes the best solution to a technical problem is a policy change.
4. Learn the terrain: Research, experiment, and ask questions before forming conclusions.
5. Be explicit and honest about trade-offs and opportunity costs.
6. Identify points of leverage: the smallest change with the largest controllable impact.
7. Just because something has always been done a certain way, doesn't mean there isn't a better way.
8. Just because something is old, doesn't mean it's obsolete.
