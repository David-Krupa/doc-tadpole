## Fortune cookie style

*   Nothing is impossible, it's just poorly scoped.
*   If it's poorly scoped, it's poorly understood.
*   With understanding comes possibility.
*   The question is: will the effort of understanding be worth the accomplishment?
    *   Is the energy input worth it? If it’s not, is there another person this would be easier for? If so, let’s give it to them. Or, maybe this isn’t a valuable endeavor.
    *   Just  because you can do anything, doesn’t mean you can do everything.
    *   If we all go off and do different things, that's effort spread. If we work together and stay focused, then we get further.


## Less obtuse style

*   Hard things are hard… until you learn and practice and master the doing.
    *   If you believe you can do it, you will. If you don't, you won't.
    *   Caveat: modulate your can-do spirit with a dose of cynicism and a dose of humility so you don't bite off too much at once!
*   Technology is not created in a vacuum for the sake of technological greatness.
    *   It is built for humans to make their lives better in some way.
    *   Don't forget your humans!
        *   Caveat: Even though they sometimes forget it, developers are humans too!
*   The good is the enemy of the great.
    *   Do _something_ now instead of the perfect thing eventually.
*   Excellence requires rest.
    *   There will be times when you're certain you "almost have it." Maybe you do, maybe you don't. In most of those times, letting your mind and body rest and coming back to it fresh the next day will serve you well. Don't be afraid to take breaks, whether it's 10 minutes, 10 hours, or 10 days to keep your mind clear and fresh. In the work of innovation, you need to maintain your brain!
*   Competence and Confidence often lead us to have answers quickly. This isn't always advantageous.
    *   It can be valuable to check context, listen to others, or just let a conversation develop before delivering an answer.
    *   Learning when to step back and let others fill in the space is just as important as knowing when (and being able) to short circuit action with your dazzling intellect!
