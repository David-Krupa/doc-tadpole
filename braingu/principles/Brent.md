*   Get a good reference point
     *   Find some point that you are comfortable with and understand
     *   Learn how things interact with your reference point and keep expanding
*   Don’t be afraid of not knowing
*   Prove things are impossible/don’t work, don’t assume
*   Take small steps
    *   Rapid small steps usually leads to better understanding and faster movement later
*   Understand the underlying systems
    *   The why/how is important to make the end result better
*   Focus on solving the customer's problem
*   RTFM &mdash; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)
*   Ask questions, listen to the response (try not to ask the same question twice)
*   Work hard, but understand when it’s necessary
    *   No one is on their deathbed wishing they worked more
*   Find a balance between meeting the requirements and solving something completely.
    *   Not every solution needs to be perfect, most of the time solving to a MVP (minimal viable product) is satisfactory.
    *   Create a MVP/POC and improve based on feedback from customer/user
*   Take pride in your work
