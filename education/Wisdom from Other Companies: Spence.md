## Elon

### Basic business

*   [3 Lessons Every Business Can Learn From the SpaceX Launch](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/three-lessons-every-business-can-learn-from-spacex-launch.html)
* Elon Musk and the lens of time. How do *you* hold awesome and ethical together?

  - You have to separate the bad behavior from the individual. The way that he thinks may inform him being an asshole, but if it’s part of him being able to have rigorous engineering ideas or innovate, and there are pieces but you can choose. He finds the fanboyism disgusting. Might as well be a political figure. No one is all right or all wrong. You can pick vilified individuals (48 laws of power). Moved past the taboos. Why did folks (Hitler, machiavelli) amass so much power? Is there a warning there?  -- to him, it doesn’t have a moral balance. It’s just an understanding/analysis of what happened.
  -   Elon is that same kind of wildly charismatic, driven to a fault, individual. Another thing to learn there -- can you be extremely driven and rigorous about quality and engineering without being an asshole? He likes to think that the culture they’ve formed here is a place where that’s possible. There are folks who’ve decided he (Spence) is the asshole. Bill Gates, for example. Hard to imagine him as a secret supervillain.
  -    No one is their story. PR is a real thing. Before Steve Jobs’ death, everyone wanted to think of him as brilliant. He put together a really excellent team and got them to work well together.
*    Take away from Elon -- reasoning from basic principles is an important thing to do. Don't let the industry or well worn paths lull you into laziness. The possibilities that are actually possible/feasible are worthy of exploration.

### Tesla

*   Sleeping in the factory, it’s all chaotic, frontline workers not being treated well. Who’s in charge? He’s not in charge. Just makes folks nervous that the boss is right here.
*   He wasn’t the original founder, he just edged out the original people. What does that say about that organization and what the investors want out of the problem?
    *   Everyone could take different answers away. The reason he looks at situations like that is to get into the gaps between the PR/Marketing/Story, supernerd fanboi community on /Reddit, without putting critical thought. We tell a story about how engineering will make you cool. Then it’s not OK to point out flaws, because that undermines the coolness. You can’t say “They overwork their engineers and underpay them”. You have to stack the companies and compare and contrast.
    *   Have to push past the story to see what’s taking place.
    *   A lot of us were the kids who got pushed into the lockers. A chance to be cool, to get money, to get on the cover of a mag, to drive a McLaren… it’s seductive. The idea of being cool as a vindication for the things that happened to you in your childhood is a trope he sees over and over and over. It’s a nastiness or elitism about tech purity which he doesn’t think is valuable. Reality happens on multiple channels. Some he likes, some he doesn’t.
    *   Elon’s an easy case study to illustrate all of that thinking. He’s not necessarily the deepest or most impactful, but quite accessible. You could pick on Bill Gates, and see that there’s a story under him, where his Dad was already a wealthy business person. We never hear about him. What Bill Gates missed and got cocky about was that MS was unstoppable, and he had business folks pushing him to play the market edge, and he got to the famous antitrust case. He spent his last years at MS on trial, and it derailed Microsoft’s supremacy. If he and they in general had been able to stave off the hubris of their marketing leadership, they might not have lost the top seat.
    *   Everyone talks about what a great biz person he is, but a lot of people could have seen the antitrust case coming. They really didn’t think they were going to get got with Politics(™).
    *   Don’t buy your own PR. Remember who you truly are, and don’t believe the articles everyone writes about you.
    *   I think we see that CEO story play out a lot with lesser-known CEOs who are running a SilVal startup, and take the “I’m going to be the next…..” You might be, but chances are you aren’t going to be. Also emulating Steve Jobs doesn’t make you a good leader or a good innovator. Part of what he did was have a design aesthetic, but part was being at the right place at the right time.
*   Frenetic innovator type. You can learn a little something from each company. Innovation + biz model and also how the organization gets built up around it. How’s the Boring company work? Where’d he get the people for AI? He uses SpaceX as a feeder team to solve hard engineering problems in other places. He can get away with that because of Shotwell who held the business down and made it useful in a structured way.


## IETF



*   [https://www.ietf.org/about/participate/tao/](https://www.ietf.org/about/participate/tao/)
*   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus#)
*   Loose organization of engineers and innovators who want to move the internet forward. Tries to be meritocracy driven. Doesn’t always land. They’re behind all of the things that make the internet interoperable.
*   Biggest takeaway is practicality. That practicality often leads to compromise. They very rarely reach a state where they can’t agree or can’t move forward. Not two incompatible standards. Very rare.
*   He thinks they’ll make a decision in favor of something they don’t agree with for “what will gain adoption” socially -- well used standard more important than perfect but unused.


## Atomic Object



*   [https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/01/31/atomic-values-part-5-give-a-shit/](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/01/31/atomic-values-part-5-give-a-shit/)
*   [https://spin.atomicobject.com/](https://spin.atomicobject.com/)
    *   Content as relevant to thought leadership
    *   Their founder, Erickson, was a professor at Grand Valley. Founded in the year before or couple years before he got there. That was the cool buzz about the CompSci dept. startup in our backyard. And wow.
    *   So he followed the blog, heard about them. Was thinking about starting a company during that time, so following what they did and embedded into the local community.
    *   During college and after, he was advising startups from a tech perspective. Startup Incubator brought together more established companies like 3 years later. AO was the vetting panel for whether someone was able to be the tech advisor for the folks in the incubator. He spent an afternoon there talking to them and learning about them and having them ask him questions. He passed, which was a point of pride. Got their stamp of approval. Also a second gold star from them — TEDx talk in his last year about sustainable computing. He was summarizing his and other research about how CompSci can be more sustainable and ecofriendly. At the end, Ericson approached him and said he appreciated his talk, that he’d done a good job of breaking down concepts to a nontechnical audience.
    *   Startups on coasts not in Michigan, because of the buzz. 10-15 years ago, the whole venture capital circuit wasn’t as well tuned around tech business. There were only a couple of companies that came out of UMich and figured out how to get money that is then funding other startups in Ann Arbor. Seeing some stuff move into Detroit now, but Grand Rapids was disconnected even from that. Do you know someone who’s done this or have you only read about it online?
    *   Michigan is a great place to get educated. We have so many universities doing great stuff, but once you graduate, especially with an advanced degree, there are limited jobs available outside academia or automotive. Those who flocked to DC were seeking the job where they knew they could get it. It may have existed, but they couldn’t plug in to it. It should be fine to live anywhere because what we do is digital anyway. To the extent possible, we’d like to be a positive contributor to the brain drain. They go to Chicago or the coasts. We want to be a positive force for limiting that.
    *   Covid has changed the face of most places. More vacant apartments in New York than there ever have been, because anyone who can work remotely will pay rent somewhere cheaper.


## Valve



*   [https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf)
*   First example of an open, public employee handbook he’d ever seen. He’s always been fascinated with their flatness, in a disbelieving way. There’s always a social pecking order, so he hasn’t seen too many groups of humans that didn’t end up with someone in a dominant social position. In fact, the person with the manager label has authority but isn’t the dominant. He likes the flat idea, he’s asked people about what the reality is, and not sure it matches with the handbook. The thing that surprised him most is, they work in the same building, not remote. He doesn’t think about teams that way because he’s not so physically tied to the people he works with/for.
*   We need to get away from the idea of job titles that we copy paste. Middle management are facilitators. When we look at a facilitator who is making sure that timecards are in or whatever, administrative stuff and project management things that you expect from that layer. One thing you don’t expect is innovation or creativity. They provide organizational stability and scale, and consistency. You could have that facilitator or coordinator or some other less hierarchy word and still get those things done. They could be the instigator rather than dictator/controller. Keeping everyone aware of outcomes, you don’t have to be a manager.
*   They let their fans down a lot. That has to have something to do with the laissez faire attitude… why not halflife 2 ep 3. Never delivered. Show no intention of doing it, what the hell? Left the story unfinished. Google does this too. They start a product, you get addicted, and they vanish it because they didn’t monetize or whatever. The Halo storyline — they really understood that. Bringing the community in on the story. It’s not just theirs creatively any more.
*   Loopback to the Elon thing… Story told about him, not by him. There’s a metastory about you outside of you without you, as a company it’s super relevant.


## MIcrosoft (Satya Nadella)



*   [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-05-02/satya-nadella-remade-microsoft-as-world-s-most-valuable-company](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-05-02/satya-nadella-remade-microsoft-as-world-s-most-valuable-company)
*   **Hit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft’s Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone** by Satya Nadella \
[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HOT5SQA/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HOT5SQA/)
*   Great example of grabbing the story that ran away from Microsoft, and he reached out and grabbed the story back from the world, and went on the whole blitz — conference talks, interviews, podcasts. Because he was trying to reframe the story of Microsoft. “we’ve made changes and I want to show you the threads of those changes.” If he had come out with the book a year sooner, no one would have believed it. All of the things they did were proof points that they wanted to be better players.
*   Ballmer vs. Nadella — Ballmer was bombastic. His interview circuit where he biffed iPhone. It was tone deaf at the time, but worse in retrospect. He feels as if Ballmer lacked for vision. He was that older Microsoft guard. Whether or not Nadella is emotionally bought in, we can’t tell, but he's walking the walk. Seems like he gets it, and tuning into the vision of the community, instead of pushing a Microsoft agenda on the community.


## IDEO



*   [https://www.ideo.com/about](https://www.ideo.com/about)
*   He likes their industrial design, and the idea of having humans involved in or thought of in the design of things that humans will use. Bringing your head up from the engineering of the function of a device so that they don’t lose sight of the user/person who will need to exercise that function. He likes that creative approach to tech. He has said, “software is for people.” Sometimes we write code that’s machine to machine, but unless we’re the dev on both sides, someone else will maintain the code later. Even when the user is a developer, they’re still a human.


## Amazon



*   Spence worked for them, and was asked not to come back. The firm that he worked for had sent multiple people over, and almost all of them were asked not to come back. He went to a meeting, and got completely drug across the coals about something being terribly insecure. He was confused about what he was getting yelled at for, and ended up making the guy yelling at him look stupid. Then about 30 minutes later, he got a call from his boss back at corporate. He packed up, shut down, and talked it out. His boss was like “yeah, this customer calls me once a month, screams at me, tells me how horrible my staff is, and has to pull someone from the project.”
*   The only employer he has ever interviewed for that did not offer him a job. And they’re also the only employer that is constantly trying to recruit him.
*   He had a terrible interview experience too. He had to design a reference implementation on a whiteboard involving Texas Hold ’em. He doesn't play poker, and so couldn’t do it. He asked about the rules of the game. His interviewer didn’t know how to play the game either, and couldn’t explain it. Not understanding the difference between engineering and poker, and interviewers not being able to break from the script.
*   Lesson learned — don’t work there. Interviewing is just hard. If a company as large and profitable as Amazon can’t figure it out, he’s not going to come up with the perfect system.
