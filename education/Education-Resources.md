    FakeNet is a Windows Network Simulation Tool that aids in the dynamic analysis of malicious software. The tool simulates a network so that malware interacting with a remote host continues to run allowing the analyst to observe the malware’s network activity from within a safe environment.

    The sharp increase in the number of smartphones on the market, with the Android platform posed to becoming a market leader makes the need for malware analysis on this platform an urgent issue. In this paper we capitalize on earlier approaches for dynamic analysis of application behavior as a means for detecting malware in the Android platform. The detector is embedded in an overall framework for collection of traces from an unlimited number of real users based on crowdsourcing. Our framework has been demonstrated by analyzing the data collected in the central server using two types of data sets: those from artificial malware created for test purposes, and those from real malware found in the wild. The method is shown to be an effective means of isolating the malware and alerting the users of a downloaded malware. This shows the potential for avoiding the spreading of a detected malware to a larger community.

  [American fuzzy lop](http://code.google.com/p/american-fuzzy-lop) tries to find a reasonable middle ground between sophistication and practical utility. In essence, it's a fuzzer that relies on a form of edge coverage measurements to detect subtle, local-scale changes to program control flow without having to perform complex global-scale comparisons between series of long and winding execution traces - a common failure point for similar tools.

  With the introduction to a 64bit Windows Operating System Microsoft introduced the Wow64 emulator. This is a combination of DLLs (aptly named wow64xxx.dll) that automatically handle the proper loading of x86 versions of system libraries for 32-bit processes on 64-bit Windows.

  Today’s post presents an introduction to Pin [[1]](http://jbremer.org/malware-unpacking-level-pintool/#rp-pintool), as well as a tool which can automatically unpack so-called RunPE malware, malware that has been packed (in a specific way) in order to avoid detection by Anti-Virus software. Throughout the following paragraphs we will introduce the reader to Pin and present the reader some example uses. Then we will get to RunPE malware, how it works, and how we will unpack it. Finally, we present the reader source and binaries of the Pintool to unpack RunPE malware, as well as a usage guide.

  Pin is a tool for the instrumentation of programs. It supports the Android*, Linux*, OSX* and Windows* operating systems and executables for the IA-32, Intel(R) 64 and Intel(R) Many Integrated Core architectures.
  (Note from Brent: As a computer security guy, I use Pin to trace program’s execution and use the trace information to help me do reverse engineering and crash analysis.)

  In our previous [Disarming Emet 4.x](https://www.offensive-security.com/vulndev/disarming-enhanced-mitigation-experience-toolkit-emet/) blog post, we demonstrated how to disarm the ROP mitigations introduced in EMET 4.x by abusing a global variable in the .data section located at a static offset. A general overview of the EMET 5 technical preview has been recently published [here](http://0xdabbad00.com/2014/02/27/emet-5.0-review/). However, the release of the final version introduced several changes that mitigated our attack and we were curious to see how difficult it would be to adapt our previous disarming technique to this new version of EMET. In our research we targeted 32-bit systems and compared the results across different operating systems (Windows 7 SP1, Windows 2008 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows XP SP3 and Windows 2003 SP2). We chose to use the [IE8 ColspanID vulnerability](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33944/) once again in order to maintain consistency through our research.

  We look in detail about Angler Exploit pack’s fileless infection. Thanks to friends at malware-traffic-analysis.net who provided captures of two different instances of Angler exploit pack delivery. You can download the samples and captures from these links [Link1](http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2014/09/08/index.html), [Link2](http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2014/09/09/index.html). There is one technical [blog](http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2014/08/angler-ek-now-capable-of-fileless.html) about this infection chain. I am going to add in some more information about this particular [instance](http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2014/09/09/index.html).

  Awhile ago, I stumbled upon a service that let you write python-bots to interact with a number of external services. The basic idea was that you only had to worry about your logic, and they would provide a wrapper around API's and take care of hosting the bot for a monthly fee.

### Cobwebs

An example of what I (Brent) do when I get an idea and don’t have time to work on it right away.

This idea started with a single person’s blog post: [https://elder.dev/posts/open-source-virtual-background/](https://elder.dev/posts/open-source-virtual-background/)

I thought that was a cool idea, but it was too locked down and dependent on specific systems.  (Requires an nvidia video card and such)  From there i started doing research on how to make virtual webcams, modify the video stream real time to add in backgrounds, and then i thought, why can’t we spoof the face as well.

So now I have this collection of tabs open, waiting to combine it all into a program that will do various spoofing things with a webcam/video conferencing.
