## The Great BrainGu Business Booklist of Doom

_This list is meant to be contributed to. Please follow the format of title, link (bookshop.org, Goodreads, or Amazon), and then a note about who added it, and why._

> "Seek books out to be the hand holder of vocabulary. You have no original thoughts, so if you think of a thing but don’t know what the science is, then you just haven't found the right terms. So seek out the works, and use books to communicate thoughts you already have.
> We’re encouraging folks to take brain breaks — don’t push your face against the screen harder. Engineering has an obsession with writing code as productivity, and that isn’t healthy.
> Reading is more necessary in times of pressure. Reading is a great chance to take your cortisol-soaked brain and get it focused on something else. Sometimes when you’re working on a hard problem, it helps your brain to not focus on that."
> **_— Spence_**

> "Try to alternate between nonfiction and fiction. There is no shortage of sci-fi that considers issues that we actually deal with in technology. And reading historical stuff informs your context."
> **_—Michael_**
