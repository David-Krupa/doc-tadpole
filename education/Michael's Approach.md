## Education

*   [Technical Project Ideas Towards Learning Cyber Security](https://mchow01.github.io/education/security/projects/2020/06/19/technical_projects_security.html)
*   A lot of the Linux command line how systems work stuff, he got into downloading distros and installing, trying to find extreme baseline and how to work from there. That’s one advantage of learning before you are an adult, because spending dozens of hours troubleshooting is not a great use of your time if someone has already solved that, but if you have no responsibilities, that makes things easier.
*   Something he is not good at that he admires other people for is the skill of “I wanna learn this thing” and then going and doing it. He’s not great at motivating himself to learn it without an external push. If he’s working on something and someone says “we need to do this using this tech.” he’ll figure it out using trial and error, google, whatever. Learning by doing or just because, he has no motivation to do.
*   Partially why he has zero intention of having a Ph.D. No one thing he cares about enough to learn everything about it. Nothing that he has a particular desire to figure out the next big thing in X. He’s more interested in solving problems than in discovering things. That’s why he’s an engineer and not a scientist.
*   There’s a balance that he feels like the more experienced BrainGu engineers have, of understanding how to find knowledge and when to ask for help. And part of that may be working with the same people for a while and really understanding when they'll be helpful, but it’s a thing with newer people that he’s seen that they’ll spend too long going in circles not finding the right info. Or they’ll ask for help without having done due diligence first. Has to be intertwined with “how do you find the information?” If he understood how to teach people how to find info, the problem would be solved.


## Process

*   “Thing I’m looking up” + “thing I want to do”
*   Error messages and removing non-generalizable info
*   Search for release notes/changelog for relevant product
*   Playing with quotes and required words.
*   People who have trouble with search -- is it that they’re using the wrong words, or that they don’t understand how to apply the results they’re getting?
    *   Other engineers who have been trying to solve a problem, lmgtfy.
    *   He’s willing to spend lots of time tracking down Stack Overflow and forums and Google trying to find an answer, and finding things that are close don’t really frustrate him.
    *   Quizbowl. One of the most important skills is knowing when you know an answer but can’t remember it, vs not knowing the answer. Some middle ground where you’re not sure. But the ability to know “I have no idea”. Either I know I’ve seen this before, I know I can find it again” vs “I don’t know if it’s even possible”
    *   Domain knowledge: “I understand how this system is built. If I was building this system, this is where I’d put this thing.”
    *   Can be learned, and you can point people in the right direction. One way to do that can be through PRs/code reviews, where it’s one thing to say “this is wrong go fix it” but if you can figure out why something’s wrong in the logic (substantive), you can tell the reason that they approached the problem in this way, or they did something silly with SQL that’s an obvious vulnerability, it’s an opportunity to point them to an article describing how and why to do this right, breaking down the fundamental reason why this best practice is in place. Easier way to learn and directly apply.
