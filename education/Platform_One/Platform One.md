# Platform One
Platform One, or P1, is an organization driving change in how the DoD writes and maintains software. BrainGu works closely with Platform One on numerous contracts, from different angles. This wiki section aims to provide overviews and how-to guides for interacting with P1.

If you're new to P1, start with [[What is P1]]. If you're a dev or a PM, there are pages on [[Developing on Party Bus]] and [[PMing on Party Bus]].
