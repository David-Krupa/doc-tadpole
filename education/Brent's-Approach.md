## [Capture The Flag](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/)

Major conferences will have small challenges, dedicated challenges, and unique computer challenges like “find the exploit” or “find the password.” Submit your solution for points; the team with the most points wins. These give you things to work on and learn, and force you to learn new techniques/tools/concepts that you wouldn't have learned on your own. For some people, having someone say “go learn the things'' doesn't help them learn; they need the practical application of the knowledge. CTFs are that substitute for him.

CTFs lend themselves to training new people. First one teaches you how to SSH, identify a filetype. If you don’t know how, you have to figure it out. They give you a jeopardy board, and you get to pick “exploit for $500”. For the team effort, they try to coordinate, making sure they have a diverse team. You get exposed to stuff you wouldn’t see otherwise.

Culture building, team building, and training events.

Reading material *and* challenges. Make a note of the books.

This can be a catalyst to bring back knowledge. He (Brent) keeps logs of the resources that were helpful, so he can skim to refresh to bring it all up to apply to whatever existing problem he’s facing.


## General Principles

*   Always start at the bottom, the most base level, and then work your way up.
