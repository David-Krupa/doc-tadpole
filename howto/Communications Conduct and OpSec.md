## Communications


### Chat (Company Slack)


*   **When:** Most common for daily interaction
*   **How:** Friendly and informal tone, but always respectful
*   **Expected Response Time:** 5-15 minute response time
*   ****What:**** FYI notifications, getting group consensus, one-on-one async convos
    *   _Try to limit excessive use of gifs in other channels._

*   Share cool articles on technical subject matter into the #nerd-_channels_
*   Share nifty things about your favorite hobby into a #fun-_channel_
*   Share non-work, funny/interesting things into #random _(remember to stay work appropriate)_
*   Share important all team information into #general
*   Share information about your geographic area in #geo-_channel_
*   Collaborate with your project teammates in the appropriate #group-project-_channel_
*   Participate in making the company more awesome by joining a #spark, flame, torch, or ember -_channel_
*   Speak only in GIFs in #nerd-gif

*   **Channel Organization:** Effective communication ensures the flow of information between relevant parties, and enhances understanding, satisfaction and trust.
    *   Our Slack organization facilitates communication within our company structure.
        *   **Echelons:** We have three echelons within BrainGu.
            *   Executive echelon #corp-exec,
            *   Business Group echelon: e.g. #msg-ops, #tdg-ops
            *   Project echelon: e.g. #msg-muddogs-dev, #msg-monstermash-team
                *   You can see that project channel names start with the business group they fall under.
                *   We try not to have the business group team in the project team channels. We trust our project teams and understand they need their own channel.
                *   Project team leaders can create additional team echelon channels as needed to organize their efforts.
        *   **Inter-Echelon:** We have channels for communicating between echelons. This is also a great repository of information for learning as well as reporting on efforts.
            *   The name of the channel prescribes the two echelons
            *   Corporate echelon to Business Group echelon: e.g. #corp-management, #corp-msg, #corp-tdg
            *   Business Group echelon to Project echelon: e.g. #msg-muddogs, #tdg-rogue1
    *   **Sparks:** Sometimes we form an effort and we don't know what shape it will end up taking.
        *   We will probably want to pull together a multi-disciplined team from across the company.
        *   Sometimes these efforts turn into full-fledged projects and sometimes they just disappear as quickly as they came.
        *   We call these sparks: #spark-bazinga, #spark-centipede
    *   **Flames:** If a spark starts to catch fire.
        *   And we need to think about organizing it, i.e. staffing it, writing a contract, or turning it into a project under a business group.
        *   We call these flames: #flame-rogue2, #flame-bazinga
    *   **Embers**: Not an active effort but could re-energize by giving it some fuel.
        *   Sometimes we want an effort to be dormant for a while but not lose the knowledge.
        *   We call these embers: #ember-retreat
    *   **Torches:** When a multi-disciplined effort becomes part of the company.
        *   These are permanent. They help "keep the lights on" and don't really fit under a single business group.
        *   We call these torches: #torch-moonshot, #torch-newgu #torch-goldendragon
    *   It makes it easier to find information if we follow the same organizational scheme. And remember, this is just a plan from which to deviate. We can't foresee all situations.

### Email

*   ****When:**** After hours, written notice is needed, or information is not time-critical
*   **How:** Collegial tone, business-style writing

    *   Contact the management team at [partners@braingu.com](mailto:partners@braingu.com)
    *   Contact the Board of Directors at [board@braingu.com](mailto:board@braingu.com)
    *   Contact everyone in the company at [team@braingu.com](mailto:team@braingu.com)
*   **Expected Response Time:** 4-6 hours for a customer, 12-24 hours for a teammate

### Phone

*   **When:** Time critical notifications or high-density information
*   **How:** Straight to the point, professional, brief as possible
*   **Expected Response Time:** Immediate, if missed call back ASAP
*   ****What:**** Oh shit moments, live troubleshooting sessions, important conversations

### Video Conference (Hangouts, Slack)

*   **When:** Anytime sharing documents or other visuals, and having real-time discussions is useful
*   **How:** Friendly and informal, but always respectful
*   **Expected Response Time:** typically pre-arranged, show up on time!
*   ****What:**** Big group presentations, small group discussions, working sessions





## Conduct


### Delivery


*   Your word and your work:

    *   Underpromise and overdeliver
    *   If you say you’ll have it done by Friday, you need to be sure that’s a reasonable goal
    *   Promise only half of what you think is possible
    *   If something comes up that will blow your deadlines, share that information as soon as possible so that your teammates can help adapt or make other plans

*   Self-sufficiency vs Efficiency

    *   You need to be able to work well independently to get tasking done to deliver for your team
    *   If the work assigned to you is too much, you need to speak up so we can rebalance it.
    *   Your team is responsible for delivering to the customer; sometimes it’s better to lean on them.
    *   If you’ve tried to make something work for more than an hour without success, phone a friend. Chances are that your teammates know something you don’t and can clear it up quickly or point you in the right direction for another go at solving it on your own.

*   Time Management

    *   With a fast-paced and chaotic environment, there are a lot of tasks and deadlines. You need to be able to prioritize effectively and also manage the expectations of your customer (sometimes an actual client, sometimes a teammate).
    *   Quality of life important and there is always more work. It can be easy to get used to hustling through all the work and forget to take breaks or even to turn off for awhile.
    *   Don't be on duty 24/7, shutting off your brain from work things can be highly beneficial. Find time to snooze Slack and tune out from work. If you’re too busy, work with your team to balance that load.
    *   PTO is something you often have to plan ahead for to make it happen. Look at your calendar 2-4 months ahead and drop some dates in it. Share with your plans with your team so they can cover for you.



## Operational Security

*   What is OpSec?
     Operational security is the practice of protecting certain information to prevent an adversary from piecing together enough to disrupt your plans.


*   Who would be an “adversary”?

    *   For our Federal work: that adversary could easily be operatives of a foreign government
    *   In general: competitors who may wish to edge in on our work or gain an advantage from our technical approach, journalists who report on the cybersecurity industry and want to do an opportunistic “gotcha” piece, or really anyone who stands to gain in some way that damages us.



*   How do I protect information?

    *   Refrain from posting about your work on social media, you can’t keep your friends from being curious and you can’t stop your family from want to brag about how great you are.
    *   Refrain from talking about technical details in public where others may overhear. For those of us in the DC-metro region, this is especially prudent given the density of foreign intelligence, competitors, journalists, and regulators all in one spot.

    *   You can use Slack or Google Drive to ensure that communication is encrypted.
    *   When using e-mail, always zip/encrypt the files before attaching, then share the zip password via Slack.
    *   Do not use public WiFi to do work without a VPN connection

    *   We have standard NDAs which can share if you want to connect up with a company that we might want to partner with. Contact [alex@braingu.com](mailto:alex@braingu.com) to get setup with one between the two companies.

    *   Stored: Slack, Google, Atlassian, and many other services store your communications indefinitely (aka forever). Having sensitive details in documents or messages on those services increases the risk that they will be obtained by an adversary. Time allows more chances for a mistake, hack, or misuse to occur.
    *   Ephemeral: For most sensitive details, use secured channels where the message will not be retained (or deleted shortly after receipt). An encrypted phone line from a trusted device, using the disappearing messages feature in apps such as Signal, or having in-person conversations inside a secure place would be examples of this.



*   Control your audience: Make sure only appropriate parties are getting the information
*   Use encryption: When sharing access credentials or highly specific technical details.
*   Use NDAs: Legal documents between partner organizations provide top cover and a paper trail
*   Understand data retention: the difference between stored and ephemeral communications.

*   What information do I protect?

    *   Access credentials (usernames, passwords, PKI, etc)
    *   Names of specific customers or projects (use project codenames instead)
    *   Technical specifics (public IP addresses, open ports, etc)
    *   Financial information (contract values, personnel compensation)

    *   Traffic Light Protocol ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic\_Light\_Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_Light_Protocol) or [https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp](https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp))
        A simple marking system which lets you provide audience control. At BrainGu we use this system to protect sensitive documents and give everyone clear indications of what can and cannot be shared.
        *   TLP: RED
            *   Shared to: A specific list of recipients
            *   Recipients can share further: No.
            *   Usage: Generally used for Board- or Partner-only information. It can also be used to limit distribution to members of a single project (ie. TLD:Red - Charlotte Team)
        *   TLP:AMBER
            *   Shared to: A specific list of recipients
            *   Recipients can share further: Yes, within the organization on a Need-to-Know basis
            *   Usage: Generally used for contractual information or financial reports to the Ops team, SitRep presentations with sensitive material, and information for a specific team.
        *   TLP:GREEN
            *   Shared to: The whole organization
            *   Recipients can share further: Yes, within the organization and the “community” which typically extends to our partner companies and colleagues in the industry
        *   TLP:WHITE
            *   Usage: Generally used for internal announcements, normal SitRep materials, project information that has been specifically built and approved for sharing around
            *   Shared to: Anyone
            *   Recipients can share further: Yes
            *   Usage: Only material on the BrainGu website qualifies here.
    *   US Government Classification Guides

    *   Within the context of projects within the USG, you will receive specific training on the definitions and procedures for both identifying and marking classified information. All of this adheres to the policy laid out in Executive Order 13526. ([https://www.ise.gov/resources/document-library/executive-order-13526-classified-national-security-information](https://www.ise.gov/resources/document-library/executive-order-13526-classified-national-security-information))
    *   If you are not cleared and/or not working in a classified context and come across classified material, or material you believe to be classified, please isolate the document and immediately notify one of the FSOs (John Spencer or Brent Johnson). DO NOT SEND THE DOCUMENT.


*   Always treat unmarked documents as TLP:Amber or higher until you can confirm the intentions of the document author.
