## Key Insights

This outlines the policy surrounding quantifying, evaluating, and workflow surrounding budget requests that enable improvements to our teams' brains. 

* The purpose of this budget is to help employees grow, professionally and personally
* $10,000 set aside annually for each full-time employee
* It can be used for continuing education, certification, community involvement, and other ad hoc requests as discussed with their direct manager
* No allowlist of approved items; approval decisions will be made on an individual basis to personalize brain improvement

## BrainBudget Y-statement 

All employees have an annual budget of $10,000 to spend towards improving their brains. Some covered activities include continuing education, including higher education degrees, online training courses, manufacturing tools and techniques, certifications, and conferences. 

As BrainGu grows, the BrainBudget requires expanding and formalizing the program to increase awareness, adoption, and accounting to support employee professional development and personal growth. 

## Problem Statement 

While BrainGu makes available a fund covering each employee, few take advantage of it. This is due to various factors, including a lack of awareness of the budget, a lack of understanding of what requests are eligible for use with the budget, a lack of tracking of the funding used, and a formal process to request support.

## Gains

The primary gains will be professional development and personal growth. The secondary gains will be increased management insight into employee wants and needs better decision-making metrics regarding professional growth, and better insight into talents and education levels of employees. 

**Positives**

* Increased interaction/discussions between supervisors and employees regarding career goals and how to achieve them by tangibly improving skill sets.
* Empowered employees focused on their professional development. Employees will be informed of the process to request funds to pay for approved education opportunities. 
* Improved employee happiness and personal growth. Employees will be given the tools to request funds to volunteer, mentor, and participate in activities and events that bring them personal fulfillment. 
* Increased insight into employee wants and needs. Based on the professional development and personal growth requests employees make, supervisors and leadership will gain insight into areas of interest and talent.
* Supervisors will be able to advise and guide their direct report’s career growth and development.

**Neutral**

**Negative**

* There is room for negative feelings from employees if they are denied requests that other employees were given.
* There is room for abuse of the program. Employees could make requests simply to use the budget and get free things from BrainGu.

## Alternatives Considered

Continuing with the current status quo Education Budget.  

### Why

The new BrainBudget will improve employee engagement, retention, and a higher quantity of potential quality hires. Fulfilled employees are engaged employees, and engaged employees stay. 

**The cost of employee turnover**

While the exact costs of employee turnover vary, there’s no question it’s something employers need to manage. Some studies predict that every time a business replaces a salaried employee, it costs 6 to 9 months’ salary on average. For an employee making $80,000 a year, that's $40,000 to $60,000 in recruiting and training expenses.

Turnover seems to vary by wage and role of employee. For example, a [CAP study](http://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/CostofTurnover.pdf) found the average cost to replace a highly-educated employee is up to 213 percent of the annual salary. For example, the cost to replace an employee making $100k is $213,000.*

**BrainGu provides the resources, and employees bring their drive. **

BrainGu provides each employee with a $10,000 per calendar year budget to enrich their knowledge, career, and personal happiness. BrainGu believes that employees who are continuously learning and growing their skill sets are positive, motivated, and engaged people. Different employees have different skills and interests, and enabling this diversity makes us strong. Staying at the edge of technology means tinkering, exploring, and creating new ideas and things, constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible. In this way, employees of BrainGu will drive innovation and enable pathways to success.

Each individual is ultimately responsible for their career growth. However, we care about our employees and believe it is our responsibility to provide them with the tools and support they need to achieve that growth.

BrainGu will use this budget to enable our employees to grow and give back to their teams and communities. In addition to professional growth, the education budget can be used to expense time spent (this list is not exhaustive) volunteering, mentoring interns, hosting and participating in educational events, etc. 

### What
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">From Spence, our guiding principle here: </span>

_How do we evaluate what’s okay and what’s not?...  we use our gut. Is someone using this as an excuse to get free stuff? Or are they going to learn and grow in a way that makes them a more fulfilled employee? This fulfillment means different things to different people, and it is up to the supervisor to assess this._

This intent must be preserved in the program. The object here is to enable the process to be expedient and accountable, the managers to be enabled and discretionary, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> restrictive or prescriptive. 

**Examples**

For more concrete examples, see below. This is not an exhaustive list of qualifying items.

* Study materials, online training course costs, certifications 
    * PMP, Sec+/CISSP, CKA/CKAD, etc
* Professional association fees
    * CISSP annual dues, etc
* Employee hourly salary while training (in lieu of PTO use)
* Equipment to enable innovation or creativity - 3d printers (spool for filament, CAD software license), laser engraving machines, home lab equipment
* Personal growth examples:
    * Yoga Class
    * Martial Art/Self Defense
    * Toastmasters
    * Creative writing classes

        * Airline costs
        * Hotel costs
        * Conference fees
        * Employee wage costs
        * Travel costs / meals

**Justification:**

Employees will need to detail how this request will improve their knowledge, skills, or capabilities. Employees will need to demonstrate why/how their proposal will help them become better BrainGuvians.

Employees will need to provide proof of time spent volunteering.

**Training/Advice for managers**

Your goal is to invest in your employee’s future, education, and happiness. Requests that may be unusual will come to you - work with your employee to understand their motivation and explain their thought process, desire, and interest to you. Employees who have dedicated exceptional time and effort should be reminded of the education budget process to take advantage of it in a way that refreshes them in a creative way.  

Consideration should be given to what kind of work product they bring. Are they underperforming? Are they contributing to discipline issues or Diplomacy/Execution/Citizenship issues? Are they a detriment to the team? If there is a case to be made for these issues, they should not be rewarded with items that do not directly help them improve their issue. (Example: An employee is underperforming due to a lack of knowledge in Kubernetes. The employee requests education budget funds to take a Kubernetes training course. This is approved. The same employee requests a 3D printer. This would warrant further discussion with the employee)

If you deny an employee and they cannot provide you with the thoughts you need to support their request, managers shall advise the employee that they are free to appeal to the next higher person in their chain of command. This process can continue up to Spence if needed. The reason for this denial should be written back to the employee, so there is documentation of the process.

**Approval Tiers**

* Volunteer hours - The team leader approves the organization and volunteer role the requester fills to ensure that the mission and values of the benefiting organization align with BrainGu’s. Employees will log hours in JIRA against their educational expense ticket.
* The team leader approves all requests up to $3,000.
* The squad leader approves all requests from $3001-$5,000.
* Director approves all requests from $5,001-$9,999.
* CEO approves all requests that exceed $10,000 at their discretion. A letter of support must be provided by the team leader and co-signed by the squad leader and Director before presenting the request to the CEO.*
* *Using more than $10,000 of the budget may result in an agreed-upon prorated payback agreement.
    * For example, an employee wants to earn their Masters Degree at the cost of $15,000 per year for two years. An agreement can be reached where the employee will owe BrainGu at least two years of service after earning their Masters. If the employee chooses to leave the company before their two years have expired, they will have to pay back BrainGu’s investment, prorated. 
* ** If the requestor occupies one of the designated positions, that request goes to their next line supervisor.

### When 

Once adopted, this ADR for the new expanded BrainBudget will go into effect on the approved date.

There should also be a link to this ADR called out in the Employee Handbook.

## Conclusion

This initiative should have both immediate and long-term benefits for the company and each employee who takes advantage of it. 

We, the authors of this ADR, strongly believe that if this initiative is implemented and thought of as a primarily altruistic benefit to being a BrainGu employee, both the employee and the company will mutually benefit.

There may not always be a direct 1 to 1 correlation between dollars spent and career enhancement. Still, there are definite tangible and intangible benefits for BrainGu when employees feel cared for, invested in, and rewarded. We should not limit ourselves to what other companies traditionally approve regarding education budgets or reimbursements.
