# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

Wondering about the origins or thoughts behind any given policy at BrainGu? Read the ADRs here.

Got an ADR you need to document? Use the Y-statement format:

>In the context of `<use case/user story u>`, facing `<concern c>` we decided for `<option o>` to achieve `<quality q>`, accepting `<downside d>`.

The long form (extra section “because”):
>In the context of `<use case/user story u>`, facing `<concern c>` we decided for `<option o>` and neglected `<other options>`, to achieve `<system qualities/desired consequences>`, accepting `<downside d/undesired consequences>`, because `<additional rationale>`.
