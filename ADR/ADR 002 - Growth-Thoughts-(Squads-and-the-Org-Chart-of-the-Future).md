## Problem Statement

There’s been so much growth and churn and change over the last year (2020), that we’re always sort of off-balance. We’re trying to deal with the size we are today, and a little into the future. So instead of reorganizing every three months, why not think about Gu with 175 employees? How would we achieve 175 and keep it flat but not overtax managers?

This way of thinking unlocks a whole new layer of things. Having TPMs as squad leads implements a portfolio approach, which allows us to hire more senior business leads. It’s very difficult to hire people with great business skills and great tech skills. Breaking it out helps us hire/scale better, and puts fewer responsibilities on people in ways that allow for less context shifting.

Our agility at context shifting wasn’t always so far off. When we were five people on the same project for the same customer and stack, context was utterly shared. It helped us perform, and we thought of those behaviors as strengths. But now, without all of that, it becomes a much higher-friction activity. We’ve had to change the way the organization balances itself to account for that.

It’s recognizing that even after the business folks scale and take on parts of the responsibility of managing a contract, that forward-facing tech lead would still end up with administrative duties. There’s a transition space between business stuff (status reports, etc.), where the business lead has no context for what’s happening in the project. Filing a monthly status has to happen for every contract. Sure we could give it to Business Operations, but they’d have to corral inputs from the tech team anyway. The “Squad leader” is closer to the tech team, so they have more understanding. They can have a more high-impact interaction with Business Operations to get the other things they need done. It also limits the number of folks to communicate across teams.

## Problems with the "One Team, One Contract" construct

1.  People auto-siloed despite doing similar work, based on a sense of customer sensitivity/operational secrecy that wasn't always true. This moves the responsibility for firewalling information and setting rules of engagement at the Squad Lead level.
2. Small contracts are hard to execute without pulling a leader away from another engagement. As we scale, we need to make it possible for a leader to split time between multiple engagements while having the ICs stay mostly focused on one project at a time.
3. Because individual identity was project-focused, employee happiness was tightly coupled to project health. The idea that you can still "be a part of the team" and move your work around seems to be well received as making people feel a sense of agency, even when they don't exercise it. Nice to have options, as it were.

## People Impacts

For most ICs, this will not impact their daily work. The biggest impact is that they will self-identify with a "team+squad" vs "project". Additionally, their direct supervisor may have more directs, resulting in less hands-on management. This can be good or bad, depending on each relationship.









## Conclusion

Definitely, we need to do some living in the new structure to see how it fits.

Long term, we hope this will help burnout. This change by itself may not help much, but it reduces the barriers to having team cross-training and interaction, and being able to pick up work within the squad, rather than just “my team does this.”

There are status and strategy meetings that used to be an audience of three, that are now an audience of ten. Instead of all those things happening, the key meetings will be with people who are working on related things, where the structures in the company were breaking down on a volume basis.



## Squads should

*   Provide stability and certainty up to 175 headcount
    *   (minimize re-orgs)
*   Enable rapid scale while reinforcing quality
    *   (get it right most of the time)
*   More predictable "chain of command" and swimlanes
    *   (enable better decision making at the edge)
*   Keep it flat-ish, promoting high alignment and high autonomy
    *   (not total autonomy)
*   Allow smart, but limited exceptions
    *   (don't over-dynamic it)


## Squad Goals

*   Decouple Team-to-Contract mapping construct
    *   Teams should accomplish outcomes
    *   Some teams will support only one contract, some will support many
    *   Some teams will support product, some will support consulting, some will do both
*   Migrate away from "innovation in silos" from IIG / MSG / TPG
    *   All Engineering lives "under one roof"
*   Allow more focused leadership at the level of the work
    *   Add a layer of leadership (Squads)
    *   Cap number of direct reports in the 5-8 range
    *   Squad Leaders pickup more strategic/monthly contractual/programmatic responsibilities
    *   Team Leads retain more "on the ground" technical and daily client-interface responsibilities
