## Title:  ADR 005:Braingu Academy LMS Plan
## Version: 0.0.1
## Key Insights: 
## Y-Statement/Summary: 
To improve BrainGu’s parental leave benefit to address compliance requirements and meet and if not exceed industry standards when it comes to paid time off for the bonding time after a birth or adoption of a child. 
Problem Statement: 
BrainGu’s current parental leave policy is 10 days, which equals 80 hours. This is not sufficient for the appropriate amount of time to bond with a new infant, heal from the birthing process, and to maintain the appropriate mental health stability in order to be a productive parent and employee. To be expected to then utilize PTO hours, and if enrolled, STD leave for mothers, is not the most employee focused or industry standard for parental leave.
## Gains/Consequences: 
Increased benefit for current employees = retention
Increased benefit for prospective employees = recruitment
Taking care of our growing guber families
## Alternatives Considered: 
Developing a parental leave structure based on the different states, so having different leaves as a compliant bare minimum (and therefore, some states will not have parental leave for employees residing in those states that don’t mandate it); this may be cumbersome to administer since we have employees all over the country.
A Financial Analysis was conducted and determined that this was financially reasonable and acceptable.

 
### Why: 
Increasing BrainGu’s Parental Leave supports:
Hiring a strong workforce
which in turn drives innovation and creativity 
Employee retention
Which in turn keeps overhead costs down, since recruiting/hiring new employees can cost 20% of the lost employee’s salary (QZ)
“Companies, too, benefit from keeping female employees and their expertise.” (QZ)
Increased and continually supported diversity 
Addressing the post-child wage gap
Continued quality of work and delivery
Reduction in employee stress levels/supports work/life balance 
Gender equality in the workplace
 
### What: 
Extremely positive- As long as there is planning to supplement the absence of work productivity, this will have a huge impact on the overall morale of employees.
### How: 
Once approved, Parental Leave Policy will be implemented in Rippling, and available to anyone who requests it. 
### Who: 
HR will communicate and manage
### When: 
Effective January 1, 2022
### Where: 
Employee Handbook/GitHub/Rippling
### Conclusion: 
As BrainGu continues to grow rapidly and looks to hire more employees in a very competitive tech industry, we will need to continue to offer comparative, or better, benefits in order to attract  top, engaged, and Gu-minded talent. Since it is widely acknowledged that diversity in employees fosters creativity, innovation, and conversations, it is in BrainGu’s best interest to hire and retain a diverse workforce.  Two of the many demographics that make up diversity are age and gender.  As the workforce ages, Millennials dominate the workplace and have indicated that paid parental leave is a key benefit when looking for employment. Additionally, comprehensive paid parental leave policies have been proven critical to hiring and retaining women in the workforce.  Further, studies have repeatedly shown that not only  is competitive paid parental leave policies critical to attracting a diverse workforce, it is critical (and as a result cost effective!) for retaining it.
